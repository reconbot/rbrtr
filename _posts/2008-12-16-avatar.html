I've been using this avatar for years. Since early 2001 at the very least.

That's as original as I can find it, its a 64x64 px gif that best as I remember came from a PHP-Nuke forum pack. It's been my buddy icon, my profile pic, my tag. It's probably one of the oldest piece of digital information I have. I even lost it at one point and had to find old backups of bthsnews.org to bring it back. Yesterday it was suggested to me by <a href="http://kerrhyphen.com">Andrew</a> that instead of just blowing it up I should try to spruce it up a bit. I had tried to "smooth" it out by editing it by hand once. I got about halfway and gave up, it wasn't worth it. This time I enlisted the help of <a href="http://vectormagic.com/">Vector Magic</a> which was a school project turned commercial venture. They've got a wonderful system (best I've ever used.. only I've ever used ;-)) to work out how to take that blocky pixel art above and turn it into this.

Which I happen to like quite a lot. Hopefully it will hold me for another 5-10 years. =)
