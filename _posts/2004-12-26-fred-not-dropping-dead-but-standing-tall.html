My friends are awesome. <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/peoplejenny/DSCN3573">Jenny</a> <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/peoplealexsbirthday/DSCN2091_JPG_1024x768">Caroline</a> <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/peoplealexsbirthday/DSCN2090_JPG_1024x768">My Self</a> and <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/7-5-04-jenny/DSCN0481">Jason</a> had a brief but sweet christmas celebration the other day. They got me a tree.

We named it Fred.

Next year we're going to have a star on top to add to the ornaments we decorated. I'd like to get one of those paper like ones with light inside. I couldn't find a picture of what I want but I did find <a href="http://www.yasutomo.com/project/paperstar.htm">some</a> <a href="http://www.highhopes.com/6pointstar.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.highhopes.com/3dstar.html">stars</a> that while looking nothing like what I'm referring to are really cool and can be made at home.

They also decorated my kitchen some.

I'll update more later. In the mean time I'd like you meet my new robot Murray. He's the small silent type.
