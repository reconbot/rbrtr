So I've got Jury duty. I went in expecting a big waste of time and came out with an expected 3 weeks of trial.
Three weeks,

Seriously, three weeks I'm going to be in court evaluating a murder case.

That's one week less then a month.

I'll have my current job, and I should be able to do work after jury duty. But.. This is like a temporary career change. I'm not even sure what to make of it.
