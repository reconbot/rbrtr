I'm cleaning up the site a lot today. I'll have more on exactly what's goin on later.<br>
<br>I got the news script working again - they changed version of php on me and with the new settings it wouldn't display any news items by default. I made a quck hack that defaulted (no matter what you did) to 10 entries. Now it should work propperly.
<p>I added a gallery. Its cool. Its got a slideshow amoung other things. I like it a lot. Sorry Mike - (he wrote the old script) - but I'm leaving you for another programmer.
<p>I had some trouble with the gallery it works fine now - will be adding many photo's soon.<p>Something is also messing with the spacing of the tables. I'll have that fixed soon.
<p>-Francis
