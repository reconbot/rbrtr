I had just found a new on campus apartment. Well it was a room in a frat(?) or something... It was a building but it wasn't that big. They had a room they would rent out for meetings and we'd serve food and drink. Some one moved out so there was a free bed. A lot nicer then my room in mimosa. I had most of stuff there already. My room mate wasn't around yet. I had moved in but could I stay? I went to the president's(?) room and talked with him. He said come back when they had their orientation for new arrivals. My case was special I told him. He suggested to go talk with resident's life. I should try "strongly admiring" the former resident so I could get permanent residence there. (?) I went toward the main living area and a guy and a girl came out looking for a bed and some how got mine. I told them not to make a mess. The girl asked if I was gay, I said no, she said I could join them in a "K". What? She just repeated her self. I said it was okay and that I had a girlfriend and left.

I was walking bye the student center, it was the Rowan campus but it looked like the area by Stuyvesant high school with the water at near highway 322. Except everything was taller then it should have been. Three people (2 guys and a girl) in some strange green velvet jumpsuit (kinda like the Microsoft butterfly but no wings) walked by and stopped at the corner. It was behind a fence (a small one - I was behind it too) on the grass. They looked up, I looked up, the top of the building exploded and streams of smoke and fire went everywhere. The 3 spray painted some logo on the building and walked off leaving people screaming everywhere. The air smelled of mustard gas. Or how I think mustard gas would smell, sorta like pepper spray. I started running.
<p>
I had my friend Michelle with me. Or was it her? Thats what I called her but it didn't look like her. I told her not to breath but it was a little late. We had to run I had a gas mask at Mimosa even though I had mostly moved into my new place. We were passing people who had passed out standing up. Keep running.
<p>
Mimosa has gas masks in the floor. Every 3rd vent has a mask in it. People were swarming all over, running this way and that. I made my way past them, found a vent, took out the mask. Michelle had fallen asleep against the wall. "WAKE UP!" I yelled "you can't go to sleep". I put the mask on her and went toward the lobby. "It's Brazilian --- virus" some one said, "move or loose your vitamins". That didn't make any sense. I figured the phones were swamped I wondered if my mother was on line - she'd know how to hinder the infection.
