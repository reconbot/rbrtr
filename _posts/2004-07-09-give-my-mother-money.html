First off click <a href="http://www.avonwalk.org/site/TR?pg=personal&fr_id=1043&px=1248525">here</a>.  My mother is doing a really wonderful thing. She's going to do the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer and since cancer is on my top 10 list of <b>bad</b> things I'm helping her raise some money. When she completes the walk that money people pledge to her goes to research to find a cure to cancer. We're close to finding a cure, more so then any of us might think. It's people like my mother and those who support her that will make it all possible.

And now a word from our walker. (Karen Vaughan)

A few of you know that since graduating from Pacific College I have decided to participate in the two day, marathon-length Avon Walk for Breast Cancer on October 2-3.. This is such an important cause to me because I lost one of my dear friends, Donna D'Angelo, to breast cancer last year. This year, an estimated 40,000 women will die from the disease, one life every 14 minutes. Another woman is diagnosed with breast cancer every 3 minutes. An estimated three million women are living with breast cancer and one million of them don't yet know it.

As part of the event, I pledged to raise money forthe Avon Foundation to provide support and resources for women affected by this terrible disease. Any amount you can give is great; I just appreciate your support.

Please visit my web page linked below. I have included information on dietary and lifestyle changes that can help prevent cancer as well as suggestions to use oriental medicine in the treatment so that my participation can be educational as well as financial.

Thank you for supporting me always, but especially in this challenge; you really do make a difference.

I'd support her even if she wasn't my mother ;-)
