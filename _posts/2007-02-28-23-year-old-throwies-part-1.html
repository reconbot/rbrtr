So this past weekend I celebrated my 23rd birthday. I had a lot of fun.

Normally I plan a party like this.

1) Pick a day (and forget to tell people right away)
2) Find a venue (my house, your house, whatever)
3) Add people
4) Add music
5) Add beer
6) (optional) Add hard liquor

And no matter what, as long as there are people + beer + music people seem to have a good time. Honestly I never though Id ever throw parties, but it's worked out quite nicely a whole bunch of times. I think it started with just a few friends, and slowly expanded to have like 10, 15, 20 people at at time. Which is just right for my tastes. People I love having fun, that's the idea.

For the record, the two photographers (minus a few camera phone pics by other people) were <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/friendsphotos/Mike+Shapiro/LED">Mike</a> and <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/friendsphotos/jenny/LED/">Jenny</a>.

So for my birthday, I decided I wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwies">throwies</a>. I got the idea from <a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=6">The Graffiti Research Lab</a>, they developed them and gave them out to large groups of people encouraging them to "alter their surroundings". One of their biggest targets was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamo_%28sculpture%29">"The Alamo" or "The Cube"</a> that's in the village over on Astor Place. (I'm borring from wiki for the details, but I remember picking throwies off the cube after the event. Oh and I have to mention the unrelated <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/pranks/cube/">Rubix Cube</a> prank.)

So instead of buying beer in large quantities, I bought throwie parts. And with the help of the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/E9D2ZJ3FG0EP286JEJ?ALLSTEPS">very simple instructions from instructables</a> I decided on what parts to buy and after they arrived I stole a few rolls of packing tape from work, got a few box cutters (from my surplus order a few weeks ago) and I was all set. That's literally all the preparation I did for my birthday.

So once people started showing up (a few I had to convince to leave a showing of "the life of Brian" at another party, I promised they could finish the movie at my house but once they saw the lights everybody forgot about it.) I sat them down at a table in the living room and showed them how to make a few throwies. Nobody .. well almost nobody knew that was coming, but as it turns out, arts and crafts (like this anyway) are a lot of fun, and people are easily bribed with pizza.

Come back later for part 2.
