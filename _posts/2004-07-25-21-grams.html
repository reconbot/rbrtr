I think the premise of 21 grams is a little shaky. Not the movie it self but the tagline "We loose 21 grams when we die." It's the weight of a stack of 5 nickels, or a humming bird, can it be the weight of love? I must have missed something because it doesn't make sense to me. Why would they stick such a stupid concept on a movie that's so real? Maybe if the heart weighted 21 grams (it doesn't) or... I dunno. I'll admit don't get it.

The movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733/">21 Grams</a> was well worth seeing. I'm glad I saw it alone, away from a crowded or empty theater. I saw it with the soft glow of my over head light, the wide screen of the tv, the sound filling my head. I don't want to hear peoples opinions on this movie, its got this fragile pedestal in my mind.

And of course that's what this movie is about, fragility. Human fragility.

The rest of the movie is well done. The cinematography was quite a pice of work, being non-linear. Instead showing different things about the characters instead of actually telling their stories. The story becomes apparent eventually. Its kinda like how I would tell a story. I'd want you to know the people first but without just telling you about them, I'd show you them.

I had some trouble keeping the actors apart in the beginning but thats a shortcoming on my part. I also read some reviews where people compared it to Memento just because it wasn't showed linearly (ironically it was shot linearly - made the actors lives easier I'm sure.) and I hate them. This movie's got nothing to do with Memento, I couldn't even relate the two... they're both movies. Thats all I'll say about that.

Thinking back piecing the movie together... I dunno, I think I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

Find someone good, who likes movies, who can appreciate them and watch this with them. Or do what I did and watch it alone. Either way it's more then worth it.
