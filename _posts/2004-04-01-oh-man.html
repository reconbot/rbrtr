So I've been watching some dvds. I just finished disk 1 of Season 4 of the soprano's (link on the right side until I return it), I'm also following with season 5 (every sunday). Its a little odd seeing the two story lines join up.

I still haven't seen the "Jesus" movie. But I'm told the European title is "Jesus Chain Saw Massacre" or maybe that was the Shapiro title... I don't remember. A lot of people have died because of this movie though. Here's one more.

I continue to love <a href="http://www.machall.com/index.php?strip_id=261">Mac Hall</a>. Its like they haven't had time to think about girls in the past year or so and now they want to be in love.

You can thank <a href="http://www.applegeeks.com/blog_archive/view.php?id=378">Emily</a> over at <a href="http://www.applegeeks.com">Apple Geeks</a> for recommending my latest book purchase. Technically its a graphic novel, and then some may say its a comic. Either way some of the best stories I've read (<a href="http://www.neonwheels.com/preacher/index.shtml">Preacher comes to mind</a>) have been in graphic novel form.

I got 2 pages in when Sarah stole it. She's going to give it back tomorrow. I don't really mind though, I still have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399149864/104-6432952-2471919?v=glance">Pattern Recognition by William Gibson</a> to finish. Its a book I've been reading for a while now and I intend on getting around to finish it one of these days. It really is a good book, I even named my cell phone "Cayce" after the heroine.

Speaking of cell phones I have a new one. I can send emails with pictures free, I have plenty of minutes (I hope), it has a camera, bluetooth so I can sync it with my calendar and my address book, and the service is cheeper a month then my old sprint phone. I have a (soon to be unlocked so I can use it with any service anywhere in the world) <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=us&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&zone=pp&lm=pp1&php=php1_1_10055&pid=10055">Sony Ericsson T610</a>. It can run java programs, play midi's, and has full network support. I am quite impressed with it.

I even rigged it to control my computer, my music/movies pause when I get a phone call and I can control almost every aspect of my computer from the phone. Using it as a remote for movies as been the most interesting thing so far but it offers a lot more, I'll let you know if I come up with anything ingenious.

There's more, I just checked my voice mail and I got a happy message from my good friends Ellie and Nina, Ellie who just flew in from the UK. I also just got a phone call from Steff. I'm almost embarrassed to say, the attention makes me grin.

Alas I need sleep.
Good night.
