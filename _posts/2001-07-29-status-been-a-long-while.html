Petra has her old kernel back. Bout time. Well her new one doesn't like to use her network card. I should have it all fixed up by tonight (well later tonight.)<br>Oh and I'm home.<br>And I cut myself for the first time while shaving today. I think its because I ordered an electric one from amazon the other day. It didn't want to leave with out a mark.
