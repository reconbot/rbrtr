I had a fine dandy day the other day at a club called Beyond in Philadelphia. There I saw <a href="http://www.dandywarhols.com/">The Dandy Warhols</a> (best viewed with a webbrowser and 3d glasses) and they were quite amazing.

You can even listen to the whole album on their web site.

And you can see photos from a show I thought was the one I went to on this <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/custard_baxter/sets/856128/show/">flickr slideshow</a>
