I'm going to link you to a new favorite webcomic of mine.

<a href="http://www.overcompensating.com/posts/20080211.html">Over Compensating</a>

When you get there be sure to know what this particular comic is talking about. Read the news section below. It's important.

PS The torrent is still at 20 seeds! I can't guess how many people have downloaded it! Mainly because I wasn't involved in most of those transfers. =) Let me know if you have any complaints.
