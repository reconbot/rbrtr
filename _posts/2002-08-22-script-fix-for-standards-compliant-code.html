I've been editing again (not just the content but the text file formatting) as you may have noticed, and again, if you have any complaints, you know what to do.
<p>As soon as I have time (which means not any time soon), I will patch Mike's news script and some of my own HTML code to make the HTML on this site (1) more logical, and (2) standards compliant. My hope is that I'll be able to reduce the amount of HTML code that's in the text file and change the style in a small way as well. If you have any objections, email me.
<p>Hope you're savoring the last sweet days of summer!
