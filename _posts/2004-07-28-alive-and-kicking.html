I'm tired.

But its well deserved.

Sort of.

So I got up today and went to work. I took a cab because I was late. I had a 3:30 appointment that got rescheduled for 11:30 but some stroke of luck I had arrived at 11:10 - early. Spring and Greenwich (near the west side drive) isn't that far from brooklyn.  Someone let me in the building and I took the old freight elevator upstairs. The entire office building used to be some industrial something or other and now is chic (but I use the term loosely) loft office space.

The best thing about this office though isn't the sky lights on the top floor (though they are nice) or the wooden support beams (which are left unpainted) but the fact that before you reach a single office door there is a washroom. Its nice too, got fancy doors on the stalls and two big sinks on either side of a large mirror. The first time I saw the office it was to talk about getting a new job. I was really nervous and it was hot outside and my bag was heavy. I arrived and I felt like I was in greece. I was only just announced and I was given a chance to wash my face, my hands and cool off. The greeks they didn't even want to know your name until after you were washed, rested and fed. It was quite refreshing.

Anyway I was late the meeting was really supposed to be at 11 not 11:30 but at least the other guy was later, he didn't get there until 10 minutes after I did.

And instead of the "This kid doesn't know what he's doing, we need to find someone else to trust the future of this company in." that I was expecting I got a "well you've got a start but this will help you" and he proceeded to help me lay out the beginnings on the entire project. Man, I need to take a course in planing or something, I learned a lot today.

It was good. Class was Boring! But hey at least I learned a few things. I also found my friend Nina on tv (not for real), and England keeps coming up and that turns to Ellie in my mind as she's the only british person I know (Sorry Mike you don't count. I guess its time you became a citizen or something.) I've got about 100... no 1000, or maybe even a 10000 pictures to upload from Brian's party. I also setup 2 new galleries for other people and moved all my friends and respected photographers galleries into a single album. None of the links changed so no worries.

I'll have other people's photos of the event up soon.
