Happy thanksgiving everyone. Holidays normally give me a weird vibe, just seem sorta fake. But they're what you make of them so this year I want to give thanks. Thank you. Like... I couldn't name everybody or everything. But if your reading this (seriously - anyone reading this, you personally) thanks.

Its funny, I normally don't care about the actual date of holidays. (Just ask anyone I've already given a christmas present to.)
