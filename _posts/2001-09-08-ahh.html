It must be that time of the month or something... I think I got petra stable again. She decided not to do anything for more then 3 or 4 seconds (which included a ssh window, but I got one on long enough to restart her) today but I think I got her back. This apparently was caused by the addition of "BNETD" to her list of programs. On top of that I think the router didn't like something she did and decided to crash. Actually it just stopped forwarding packets. Oh and my laptop crashed. There must have been some freaky microwave explosion or something, Its just that everything died. *shrug* Life goes on.<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
