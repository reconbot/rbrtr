I've been absent lately. Mostly because a good friend of mine was visiting from england. And that led to many things that took me away from home. Which is probably a good thing, I've been spending way to much time in doors. It's a good thing to know one can leave home and stay out as long as they wish and still be completely functional. Or rather that they can be functional out doors, which is the part I'm quite glad about.

Now I'm not being totally clear here, I'm not a shut in. I've just been busy... And procrastinating.... which means I never have time to do anything at all

At least that's how I'm feeling.

I'm sure I'll get over it.

I did manage to spend an entire day walking around a zoo while only getting hit once or twice. (I can't quite remember, I was operating on very little sleep.) I must admit I deserved it a little. I was in a trouble making mood.

I also managed to attend an "elegant dinner party" which I was ill dressed for (though not completely). It was the first time I actually needed the dress clothes that my brother destroyed a year or two ago. I think after my next big job I'll get my self a nice set of formal ware.

I also got to see Snatch and Anastasia which were completely unrelated and decent movies. Snatch was just good. I also had the pleasure of explaining the plot to Nina a few times, I think it just moved a little fast for her. Apparently the fast talking British are no match for me though as I understood quite a lot of it and followed the plot quite nicely. Though I had some trouble with the Pikies as they talk in such a manor to confuse you. I had to turn to Ellie quite a few times for help.

Ellie was quite a pleasure to see again. She is an odd one though, but I've gotten used to that. ;-)

And thats my post for the week. I hope to have something a little more... umm well written for you next time.
