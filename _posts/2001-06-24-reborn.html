Peter died... Twice... Well after more then 2 weeks of "error 404, not found" roborooter.com is back. Most of the stuff from peter is transfered over and I think we are now accessable from everywhere. (yippy!) I also made this server by my self 100% which I'm also proud of. It consists of: <br>2 Celeron 450s <br>64mbs of ram (not too much but, well.. $) <br>a 4 gig hd (not too much but...) <br>a 60 gig drive ( =D  its for backups, realy!) and some other stuff... Its also a full tower case that lumbers under my desk like a giant. Its a huge case! I also want to get <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/3735.html">this</a> sometime soon, it would be very cool. Look for another major update soon.<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
