<img src="/images/jumper.gif" align="right" />Today I fixed a potential head crash in Peter's new hard drive. (Peter is my server) I just remembered to always check the jumper settings in the manual, not just on the drive. (I'm hating western digital) <p>I also ended up calling their tech support at one point, and found out that sending your drive in for data recovery can cost anywhere between $100-$5000 dollars. <p>If my drive was in fact dead then I would want to get its data recovered (I didn't have to but it would have been nice) but after hearing that price tag it was no longer an option. If you look to the right you'll see the jumper configuration for all new EIDE drives. On the actual drives you'll see something quite different. Apparently these are *special* settings for drives larger then 2 gigabytes. <br> -Francis
