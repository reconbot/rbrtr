So after 3 days of thinking about it I started making my own knoppix livecd for the purpose of ghosting the machines at 51. I've got to make a debian installation small enough to fit into ram if I want to be switching cds out of of the computers. I'm hoping I have 128MB to play with. I don't think I could do this in 64MB without starting over. I may end up having these dam machines netload, it's just going to go a hell of a lot slower that way. I wish I knew a thing about multicasting.

Either way I now know how to "Remaster" a knoppix cd. I feel so special =)
