There was this convention in New York last weekend that if I had more time (or were two people) I would have gone to, but I was just too tired. It was called the "MoCCA art festival" and from what I can gather it was amazing. Hundreds(?) on artists from most of my favorite webcomics attended. I could have met them all. On the other hand I went to the Cony Island Mermaid Parade instead and got to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Savage">Adam Savage</a> among hundreds of other crazy interesting people. (Not meet though, he was too busy being a king of the Parade. I'll be posting my photos later.)

<a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=87">R. Stevens</a> of the illustrious <a href="http://www.clango.org">Diesel Sweeties</a> (now in papers!) pointed out Matt Madden and his <a href="http://www.artbabe.com/exercises/exercises/">Exercises in Style</a> where he took one simple real world situation and presented it a about 10 different ways. And if I read this right he has a book coming out with a lot more. It's really neat. I like the concept.

I've got most of my comics in RSS feeds these days so I don't need a list of links to click anymore. Seriously <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> is amazing. (Click <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/16514805599063832604/label/comics">here</a> for a feed of most of the comics I read daily - note that link is not <em>how</em> I read them daily, I use google reader, that's just a prettied up rss feed..)
