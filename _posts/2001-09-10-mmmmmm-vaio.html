<a href="http://www.quasi-evil.com/"><img src="images/starlogo.gif" align="right" /></a>I got the nest version of <a href="http://www.php-nuke.com">php-nuke</a> (when the hell did that come out?) and set it up. Still doesn't work. Also on a side note, I don't know how to use MySQL. Yesterday I went by <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a> with my laptop and new wireless card to see if I could find something useful with there new wireless network (which you have to pay for if you want Internet access) and I saw this guy. He had the tiniest <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/vaio/picturebook/index.html">Vaio</a> I've ever seen! It rocked! On top of that he didn't know how to use windows so he had gotten rid of it and put Linux on it! This guy was cool. Anyhow It time to relax.
