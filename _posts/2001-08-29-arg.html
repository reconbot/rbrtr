Petra (Dawn-Ann) is now truly a headless server. For some reason today her keyboard inputs started messing up and failed completely. Her mouse wasn't hooked up at the time but its dead too. After some work I found the problem is hardware on the motherboard. Sucks for me. I think it doesn't matter though as long as things continue to work. I can only pray though.
