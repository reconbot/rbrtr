Jason reorganized my sidebar for a prototype of a redesign he was working on  (one you might see sometime soon) and I liked it so much I decided to just use it now and not wait until we work out the next version. It really is organized much better then it used to be.

Also, I forgot to include another <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/tripsengland">England Trip</a> album on my last post so you get two this time.

<a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/LondonHarrow">House on Harrow on the Hill</a> and <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/StPauls">St. Paul's Cathedral</a>.

Oh man I loved that Cathedral. They wouldn't let me take photos of the inside so you're only going to get the outside and from the dome. The paintings and sculptures were amazing. I figured it probably took 10-15 years and hundreds of people to complete the building but it only took 5, good planning I guess.  If you goto london go here. Trust me.
