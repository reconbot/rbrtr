I found this site on some one else's website.

<a href="http://www.notfoolinganybody.com/">Not Fooling Anybody</a>

Its a collection of store fronts that are pitiful modifications of older storefronts from other stores.

My favorite one has got to be <a href="http://www.notfoolinganybody.com/24kembass/">Kembass Cleaners</a> quite pitiful.

<b>Update:</b> I think I have my calc situation fixed. More later
