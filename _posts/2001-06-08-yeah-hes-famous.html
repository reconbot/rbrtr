<img src="/images/blake.jpg" align="left" /><img src="/images/frantrinpic.jpg" align="right" />Well, Francis wasn't kidding about being famous. Sorta. Well, thats him, alright. (The kid, you idiot!) This pic came from <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/envir01.htm">here</a>, so take a look at the other shots. If Francis ever gets off his @$$  (even though he is very busy with studying for finals) and finishes the staff pictures I made, that Staff link over there will actually go somewhere. Anyway, its friday, and I want to go crash at my friend's place, so the actual staff bios will have to wait. If you work here, and want a bio that isn't demeaning and grossly inaccurate, write your own and mail it to me.<br>-<a href="mailto:rooney@roborooter.com">Rooney</a>
