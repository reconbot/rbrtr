Last night I saw radiohead in concert. *grin* It was good. I can't say I like the tweeter center too much though. (Its located in Camden right near Phillidelphia.) The sound isn't as good as other open air venus. At the PNC bank arts center (quite a bit north of the tweeter center but still in New Jersey) you can still feal the sound out on the grass. And as one of my friends who went to this concert says Madison Square Garden (not open air but just as large) is good becasuse even if you have bad seats (they just keep getting higher and farther away.) you can still get good sound.

They way I figure it. I can sit at home and listen to music. I have decent speakers (Klipsch 2.1) and if I really wanted I could go use my Audiophile Godfather's speakers but really even with headphones you'll get better sound then at a concert. So you don't goto a concert for the good sound. You go because you get to be around 200 people grooving to the same sound you are. You go because you like to be able to sing along at the top of your lungs and just have your voice (as off key as it maybe) just add to the collective singing of the audience. You go because you can jump around, get sweaty, yell, make a jerk of your self, dance all crazy and not even stand out. Even at mild concerts - Let me just make a quick note that I'm talking about Classical Concerts, I'm talking about rock, concerts and the like. You won't find the boston pops at the Electric Factory. As I was saying.. Even at mild concerts you can stand up and feel the sound flow through you. The concert is an experience it isn't just the music.

When I went to go see Zwan at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia I had palpitations. The music was loud, not too loud but loud enough that when Paz would play the base guitar I could feel it vibrate through out the crowd in your chest. They played a song called Jesus with long pulsating chords and some girl in the front told Billy (the lead singer - who told the crowd) that she had an orgasm. I can believe it. The song could pick you up and carry you for .. minutes (hey its only one song) its good.

Anyway I've got to get to sleep, tomorrow I've got a jam packed day. Two things first.
1) If you have a copy of the game postal that is not yours, give it back to Michael please.
2) I have a whole bunch of unfinished posts that I indented on finishing before I leave for school on friday.
