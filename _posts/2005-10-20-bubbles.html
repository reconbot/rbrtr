I sorta lost the link I wanted to share, I searched my history relentlessly but to no avail. So I'm going to describe it to you and use some things I did save from the site.

This guy <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/d/48936-1/01Giacometti.jpg">put speech bubbles on advertising</a> around new york. Blank ones, about 15,000 of them. And then people wrote things on them and this guy took pictures.

You can <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/d/48933-1/Bubble_Template_Sm.pdf">download a pdf</a> of some speech bubbles and print them out, post them around maybe.

WOOOHOO! I found the link. you can tour around his site and see all the photos, some of them are really funny, New Yorkers rock.

I'm surprised I haven't seen any of these around, I mean he printed 15 thousand of them. Judging from some of the ads I'd say he started in early 2002 maybe. I'd put this whole project right up next to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/05/walkdontwalkman_remi.html">dressing the crosswalk guys</a> in my book of cool urban vandalism.
