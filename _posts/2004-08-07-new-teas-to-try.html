Chamomile with Lavender
or
Mint Earl Grey


I had a good time hanging out with Jenny and Jason and Caroline tonight. Tomorrow I need to finally clean up my floor and take care of all those little things that I have nowhere to put. And then at some point go see a play.

I want to write stuff, about people and things. And me. And I guess this is what a journal is for not a blog but... eh

Stuff happens, I think oddly sometimes (hey, we all have our moods, good, bad and odd), and its good to know you've got good people to turn to. =)
