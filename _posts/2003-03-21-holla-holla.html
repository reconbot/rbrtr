I had a nice walk in the city today. All over north times square. For about 3 or 4 hours me and a bunch of good friends ran around searching every restraunt and diner in the area.<p>Searching? Why you ask?
A kid named Hollis (forgive my spelling) who has the money for the 9 of us to eat and who also had Cassie's little sister Sammy. We were suposed to meet them on the corner of 55th street and Broadway. Cutting to the chase. I now have a good fealing for most of the restraunts in the area, a nice amount of walking under my belt, and a wonder of why Hollis was on 42nd street in a Chi Chi's that happened to be in the second floor of a lowes movie theater.<p>
He had long since left when we finaly found the place. We were suposed to have met at the non existent Broadway Diner on the pre mentioned corner.
We figured that even though it didn't exist he'd at least be there. I don't know how the hell he ended up where he did. I just know I spent almost 3 hours in the rain waiting for him. Good think I like the rain.
