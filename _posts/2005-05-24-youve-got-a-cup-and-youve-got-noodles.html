I went to make myself some Ramen noodles. Not just any ramen noodles but ramen noodles that I broke an egg over while I was cooking them. My mother told me that it was a tasty way she got protein with her sodium, back in college. It's easy too.

I went looking for the <a href="http://www.nissinfoods.com/top.htm">Official Ramen Homepage</a> but found a better <a href="http://mattfischer.com/ramen/">Official Ramen Homepage</a> instead, complete with it's own <a href="http://mattfischer.com/ramen/index.php?p=320">Quick Egg Ramen</a>. The other day I threw an egg in with a <a href="http://www.nissinfoods.com/cup.htm">Cup Noodles</a> and while I had to watch out for overflowing it seemed to work well too.

<a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/ramen/ramen.html">These guy's are always fun.</a> "The next time you are in the mood for a long lunch, cook yourself some instant Ramen, the longest lunch!" And how.

That's all for now folks. Check back later when I post entries I started almost 1 month ago! Actually they were some pretty interesting stuff, makes me wish I had finished them back then.
