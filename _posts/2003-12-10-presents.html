I've been making a list of people to get stuff for. And then.. People asked me what I wanted...

I really can't think of much else. I mean if you give me a card and a hug I'll be just as happy. Or you could always click my pay pal link on the right and send me the $5 they give you to sign up. (Or do they not do that anymore?) The holidays shouldn't be about giving gifts (even though I'd like to give a bunch) it should be about the people you're around. The gift is just an excuse to make them happy.
