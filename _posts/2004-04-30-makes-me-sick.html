<a href="http://www.tricityherald.com/tch/local/story/5007720p-4935696c.html">Tri City Herald</a> ran a story about some kid who drew anti-war sketches for a school assignment. The kid turned it in and the school turned him in to the Secrete Service. Can you honestly believe this?

Thanks to Mom who emailed me the article.
