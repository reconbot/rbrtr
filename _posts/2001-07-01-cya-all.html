Well this is it, I'm gone for 3 weeks. I finaly got the dynamic IP updater to play friendly so Roborooter.com will stay up by its self. I failed to get the new kernel in place though, I just didn't have time. Maybe If I'm luck Koudelka will find him self board one night and do it him self. But its not bloody likely. (Its ok, he's going to be busy enough for him self.) I should probably stop screwing around and finish packing, then goto bed. I have to leave for the air port in 4 hours... <br>Well enjoy your selves everybody. I know I'll try to.
