I'm moving sometime near the end of this month so I'm selling off anything I can. From my real cool looking <a href="http://store2.yimg.com/I/e3worldwide_1695_1116756">disk</a> <a href="http://sevens-alcove.virtualave.net/alcove_r.jpg">thing</a>, to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/toys/B00000JRI4/pictures/14/104-4857234-9696738#more-pictures">radio controlled motorcycle</a> to my beloved <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/hardware/sidewinder/force-feedback/default.htm#">Force Feedback Joystick</a> (it's treated me well).<br> This is really depressing&#8212;I love that joystick!
<p>(<em>Some time later...</em>)
<br>I've also got a bunch of books and stuff I'm going to be giving away. The good books I'll lend (and probably forget about...), but the mags (like 20+ issues of wired) and programing/anything for dummies books are useful to others but useless to me, so get them while they're cheap. Just email me (at the link below) or if you know me give me a holler. (I'll ship anything to anyone but its cod all the way; I'm broke.)
