One day I'll watch the movie with someone and it will have the effect it should. I saw it in theaters a long time ago but that night my mind wasn't really there. I didn't get that fulfilled feeling, I wasted my time.

Thanks to Frank for buying me the soundtrack off my Amazon wish list. It's good music for a dam good movie.
