I was driving down the west side drive the other day and took a horrible picture of <a href="/archives/images/DSCN3072.JPG.1024x768.html" onclick="window.open('/archives/images/DSCN3072.JPG.1024x768.html','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">*this*</a> car. The people in it were nice enough. We chatted long enough to take the picture and for me to give them my URL. Who ever you are hope you enjoy the pictures.
