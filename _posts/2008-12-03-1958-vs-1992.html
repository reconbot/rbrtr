I got this in my email today. It blew me away.
<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img009.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-826" title="Lawrence's 2nd birthday." src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img009.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Compare it to me <del datetime="2008-12-03T21:07:21+00:00">around that age</del>.

My dad looks like a cross between my brother and myself. My grandfather... well he just looks young, and quite happy. This photo and a few others came from a new cousin that found us from Kansas City Missouri. I want to publish his collection. It's not one we had ourselves. Also kudos to the kid with the Brooklyn Tech shirt, it's still the same one they use for gym today =)
