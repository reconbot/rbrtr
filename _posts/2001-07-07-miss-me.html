Tit's me again. No, not him, he's in the middle of the desert. To tell the truth, I've been afraid to show my face around here, due to the fact that I have done nothing but make snide and sarcastic remarks on this page. So where did I get the courage to post once more, you ask? Why, I am in the process of getting a buddy of mine's comic site moved here. This is taking a while because he's in Canada (shudder) right now, and I can only talk to him every week or two for about 15 minutes.<br>You can visit his site now <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010819183236/http://www.imaginationcomics.com/">here</a> but be forewarned: it is infested with popups and banners. Aside from that, there's little to report. Francis and Mike have both gone, so don't expect any big changes until one of them gets back. I'm doing my best to learn enough to add the aformentioned comics site to ours, but don't expect to much from little old me and Emily. Rome wasn't built in a day, but I'm sure it got off the ground faster than we are.
