I fixed roborooter.com mail! Yahoo!<br> Honestly I don't know what
broke. All I did was restart. I feel dumb about it too, because I
restarted the server not the mail deamon. I shouldn't be using such a
crappy misconfigured deamon anyway. At least I'm not open for realying.
No spam comming of me. No message from me comming of me either. I never
did get user authentication working.
<p>UPDATE<br>Yay I fixed BTHSnews.org. Now only if I knew what broke in
the first place.
