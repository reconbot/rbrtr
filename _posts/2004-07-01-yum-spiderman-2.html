So I hear people are calling its Spiderman's Empire Strikes Back.

It fits.

Doc Oc was done quite well (though he shouldn't have been able to take so many punches from spidy) and you got to see Peter Parker a lot more. Our beloved hero spent quite a bit of time with his mask off and you got to know the boy Peter Parker (My age it seems.) a bit better.

But even though in the previews he gives up being spider man you know he comes back, and you know that Peter Parker doesn't loose to Spider Man and that things work out. I mean there's going to be a Spider Man 3 in 2007.
