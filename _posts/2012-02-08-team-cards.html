A friend of mine recently made some really nice personal business cards on <a href="http://moo.com" title="moo.com" target="_blank">moo.com</a>. Crazy nice printing, nice thick stock, large high quality photo, double sided. I feel like Patrick Bateman just thinking about it.

I decided to make a wish a reality, so I got some for my team.

We can write ticket numbers on the back in silver sharpie and leave them on peoples desk when we're looking for them. Eventually I'm going to run a technological strike team. =D
