Yesterday a little girl ran up to me and hugged my leg hiding behind it. She thought I was her mother. I had seen her before in the Laundromat she was very proud that she got to put the money in the machine and was telling everyone much to her mothers dismay. She must have only been three. Anyway she had just gotten her self into a fight with the pizza guy. ("You can't punch me!" "Yes I can!" "Ha! you just gave me five! I won't give it back. You gave me five!") Defeated she came and took shelter behind my leg. "Wrong person honey." her mother charmed in. The girl looked up at me smiled and ran and hid behind her mother. She even thought it was funny. <p>
On a note about the matrix I present you with <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/images/thematrix.jpg">this</a>.<p>
Work has been less then satisfying lately. Too much to do, to much shit to deal with. Don't take up IT jobs if you can help it. Especially if you are the only person working there.<p>-Francis
