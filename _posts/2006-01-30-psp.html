The Sony PSP is an incredibly well designed beautiful useless machine. It's got a powerful processor, A beautiful screen, a wireless card, good battery life (if you don't use the UMD drive) and does squat with it.

And Greg from <a href="http://www.reallifecomics.com/">Real Life Comics</a> has <a href="http://www.reallifecomics.com/daily_old.php?strip_id=1608">made my day</a>.

I still think it's about ten thousand miles from being useful, I mean someone got windows 3.1 to run on it, we could at least have audio or video chat with a USB (it's got that too) webcam. ... ooo I'd kill for a touch screen on that baby, heck even just a stylus so they could keep that screen behind the protective plastic...

One day it will be useful, one day.
