This one goes out to Alex, My favorite link bomber.

<a href="http://www.frozenreality.co.uk/comic/bunny/index.php?id=31">Jesus is found</a>

And last but not least <a href="http://www.queenofwands.net/">Queen of Wands</a> has finally come to an end. It was a good story, Kestral shall be missed.

<a href="http://www.queenofwands.net/d/20020722.html">The first comic</a> in the series is poorly drawn imho and it takes a dozen or so to get into some sort of story. I'm sorry to see it go, but I'm happy that it had a planned ending. I like stories.
