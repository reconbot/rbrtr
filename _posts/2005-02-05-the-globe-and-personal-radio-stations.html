Let me get this out of the way. <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/TheThirdGlobe">The Third Globe</a>

Forgive my snippy captions, My heart just isn't in it today. Also if you look at the <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/tripsengland">England</a> gallery you might notice this comes before Westminster and Trafalgar Square, I missed this one, and the next one too. I'm trying to keep some semblance of chronological order.

So I found this site called <a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a>. It's neat, the community submits links and rates them, not a bunch of editors. So the crap you find there is picked by your peers, switches the blame to everybody instead of specific people.

Anyway, I found a neat setup for <a href="http://www.codepoetry.net/archives/2005/01/15/doityourself_smart_radio_station.php">iTunes playlists</a>. It produces a nice mix of music you haven't heard  with music you like. I have three different playlists total and varied a little from the suggested ones.

The first one has music that I haven't played more then 5 times and haven't rated 1 or 2 stars (which mean I think they suck). It's limited to 300 songs chosen randomly. The second has stuff I've played more then 3 times, has more then 2 stars (3 and above), and I haven't played in the last week. It's limited to 200 songs chosen by least recently played.

The 3rd playlist is just a combination of both. This playlist will play every song (unless I've already rated it a 1 or 2). Songs will randomly show up 5 times and if I haven't rated it at least 3 stars I won't see them again. If I have rated them at least 3 stars they'll be thrown into a nice rotating list of songs I like. The mix is 3 parts list one (or Infuser) and 2 parts list two (or Sprinkler).

It works well.

Ohh and until I fix it the random image is broken. I'll figure it out later I don't feel like it now. I'm in the middle of moving everything, so stuff might break in the process. *shrug* What ever.
