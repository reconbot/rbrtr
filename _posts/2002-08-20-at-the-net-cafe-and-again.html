Tomorrow I leave San Francisco, and I don't know when I'll be back on the net.
<p>I'm taking down music.roborooter.com. I'm sure those who knew it was there won't care. Those who didn't know can go to <a href="http://www.frontalot.com/">http://www.frontalot.com/</a>. It was just his music.
<p>I put up a few new pictures (not all from this trip though). I'll have the complete collection (which isn't finished yet) up when I get back. Talk to you all later.
