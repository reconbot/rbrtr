ABOUT FUCKING TIME!

<a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2004-04/05/17.00.sfc">SCI FI Brings Back Farscape</a>

I was watching Stargate SG1 and I saw this commercial and it was for a mini series of Farscape and it was good. This show was really good, oh man I'm so happy they're bringing it back, if not at least for a mini series.
