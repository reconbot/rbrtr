I had a brief lived application on facebook. It mostly worked right and would load all your photos and put them in a big FB random tag and stick it on your profile. I had it upgraded by Koudelka who played around with Facebook's javascript subset and got a little Ajaxy (+) link that would load a new photo. After that I ignored it. =)

Until it broke, and you had to hit the + to get a photo at all.

It was shitty hack. Code that was never planed.Â  I killed it this morning. I'm backing it up but.. you don't want to see its code. It was a mercy kill. It will be tough but.. the 16 people who were using it will have to move on.

I like to think that in a world of fb apps that include inviting friends to be zombies or go out on hot virtual dates with bumper stickers and snowball fights, my app was a little bit of hope. Hope for functionality without advertising or annoyance. Too bad it was broken.

I will miss you "<strong>Random Profile Image</strong>" but honestly.. not that much.

<strong>Update:</strong> I had over 3.2k photos logged (I don't have the photos, I just knew about them so I could pick a random one.) that's an amazing amazing amount of photography to share.
