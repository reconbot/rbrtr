HBO On Demand. I find out after how many months that we already pay for HBO
ON Demand? Aparently with no extra cost (besides the monthly fee they already
have us paying and we didn't know it) I can go and take my remote and click
my way into almost any HBO show, movie, or special.<p>
Over the past few days I've watched the first 6 episodes of Six Feet Under and
right now I'm on my 4th Sopranos episode (this one is number 21).
I'm seeing dead people and angry mobsters everywhere. Tony Soprano...
Tony Soprano... The only thing I can say about him is that I'm glad I don't
identify with him. But the idea that he might scares me.<p>
Nate from Six Feet Under. He's a thirty something year old who comes home
for christmass to have his father die and then ends up staying. He's lost.
He doesn't know where he blongs in life. He left Seattle (a very nice place I
might add), his job (wich was suposed to be temporary), his apartment
(which was suposed to be temporary), and everything he knew to come home and
join the family mourgatory bussniess which he spent his entire life running
away from. I like him. I can identify with him for some reason. He's got to
find him self.<p>
