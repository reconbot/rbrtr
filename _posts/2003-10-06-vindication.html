Someone cut me off in Esby parking lot today. Stole my spot. She new I was there first and when the guy pulled out she pulled right in front me. I was lucky enough to find a spot a few minutes later, but what if I wasn't? I was already late to my 11 o√≠clock appointment.

Still brooding over her lack etiquette later in the day and not satisfied with the verbal reprimands I gave her when she stole my spot, I checked out her parking tags while I dropped some books off in my car. They were temporary resident tags. They hadn't expired yet but Esby is a commuter lot. I called Parking Services. She has a ticket.
