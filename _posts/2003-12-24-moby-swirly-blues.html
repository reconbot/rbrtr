I just found a copy of the playlist I used to create my Moby Swirly Blues mix. Its 19 Moby songs in a quite soothing order. I made it to use to goto sleep but people (like my Dad of all people) started to like it so I burned a few copies to keep around the house. (All fair use of my music that I legally own - I assure you.) Anyway I had since lost the cds and the playlist and now they are found.

The name comes from a friend of mine and of course Moby.

Read on for track names and albums they are from.
