So the other day I saw the release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">ipod nano</a> and thought to myself. "Steve, that's really cool but you're lying to me." I was wrong.

But.. it make me think of this <a href="/ftp/movies/pregnancytest.mov">movie</a> I found. It's actually by a New York sketch comedy group called <a href="http://www.whitestkids.com">The Whitest Kids</a> they've got some funny stuff.
