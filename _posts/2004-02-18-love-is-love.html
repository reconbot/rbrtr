"Parts of the brain that are love-bitten include the one responsible for gut feelings, and the ones which generate the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine. So the brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of people experiencing strong emotions, but instead like those of people snorting coke. Love, in other words, uses the neural mechanisms that are activated during the process of addiction. ìWe are literally addicted to love,î Dr Young observes."

What is love? Who knows? But this excerpt is from the <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=2424049">Science of Love</a> and it oddly enough all started with Voles.
