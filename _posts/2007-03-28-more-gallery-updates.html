Ok I stayed up a little later and added a few more gallery features.

Tags, tag cloud, random, popular, and recent changes.

Like say you have this picture here.
<img src="http://gallery.roborooter.com/d/52508-2/Photo_011006_010_1_.jpg" alt="alex" />
I tagged it alex, so if I goto <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/tag/alex">gallery.roborooter.com/tag/alex</a> I get every picture tagged alex (well when you edit a photo it's called keyword but whatever). Flickrish and nifty eh?

Also at the bottom of the main gallery page you have the "tag cloud" which shows the most popular tags bigger.

I already posted about the <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/random">random</a> but now there's also <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/popular">popular</a> and <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/updates">recently updated</a>. And if you're in an album there's a link on the side that give you these features with regards to an album instead of the whole site.

Ok That's all for now.
