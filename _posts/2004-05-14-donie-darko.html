I should have gone to bed, but I don't regret it. I just got to watch my very own copy of Donie Darko. I got it for my birthday and had lent it to my brother. I'm glad I have it back. It's such a story.

(I've got about 1000 thoughts I want to share inspired from this movie. About love, hate, time travel, alternate dimensions, pre-destiny, self censorship, small town society, beliefs and how then can consume, and some more on love.)

I'm a firm believer that a belief or theory should be used, shared and discarded. Like shucking fresh corn. Except I don't think we'd ever be done believing things, I don't think we'd ever find what ever absolute truth we were looking for.

I think I also miss California. The kind of missing where you haven't actually had the thing you miss, it's almost like I miss the yearning for the mountains and the climate. I wonder how my mother puts up with such a loss.

And while I'm on the topic (whether you know it or not). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806173036/http://www.allsci.com/parallel.html">A Home Test for Parallel Universes</a> I don't actually believe it but it is neat. It really shows diffraction at its best, I'm remembering something about double-slit experiments in physics. Either way, its neat.
