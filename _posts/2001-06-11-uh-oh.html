I've rediscovered <a href="http://www.dslreports.com">DslReports</a> and made an account. I was playing around and ran a line test on my connection. I found the dissipointing results <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/quality/nil/437850">here</a>. I will definatly be changing the location of this server.<br>Other news I got my cast removed today. The arm is still fractured though... It will be a few more weeks untill the bone is healed and then a few more untill my mussles return. (It's scary my left arm looks like its not my own.)<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
