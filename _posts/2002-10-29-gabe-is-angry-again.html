Registration is closed.<br>
I hate school.<br>
I'm under the opinion that the registration process is setup for people who magicly know all the classes and when they are and how they fit together. They have this handy dandy tool that helps you organize your classes but its got its problems.<br>1) It won't tell you if a class is open or closed. In order to find this out you need to sort through 3 pages of submenus till you get a nice little table of the classes.<br>2) It won't register you for the classes. You need to get the 5 digit call number for the 7 digit class number to register the class and then goto a differn't part of the "<a href="http://sinfo.rowan.edu/">web for students</a>" system.<br>3) You can't have multiple windows within the web for students system. It aparently has some session tracking with out cookies. I applaude the attempt but they should have played with it on a message board not our fucking registration.<br>4) The course search/schedule maker defaults to fall 2002 term. I spent 15 minutes (I needed that 15 minutes! read below) franticly looking for a course of mine that dissapeared.<p>
I ran out of time and therefore I am only registered for 3 of 5 classes. My schedule looks like this.<p>

Which still sucks a lot of ass. Four fucking 8am classes and nothing I can do about it. Well thats only 4 if I can actualy get that class. I need that class but I'll have to check in the morning.
<p>I'm self medicating with pocky. Its good food for not actualy being food. I'm also told I probaly have mono. Which I find hard to belive since I already had it about 4 years ago (sucked then) and I don't feel completely wasted now. I'll I do know is that it hurts like hell to swolow, I have a gland thats making my neck swell to about twice the normal size and its not strep throught. I get the results for my lab tests (on my blood) tomorow and on friday (2 tests). If it is mono then nothing happens. I live with it. If it's not then nothing happens. They'll just tell me to rest and drink liquids.<p>On a side note I had to walk about an hour in the rain to find the lab place to get my blood test. The directions the people at the medical center gave me sent me about a mile out of my way. If they didn't try to keep me not sick I'd hate them too. For now I'll just hate the registrars office.
