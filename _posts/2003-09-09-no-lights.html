I've got a lot on my mind but I'm not sure if I should say it all. I mean I could probably rant for a minute or two and the only person I really want to read it would only respond with a condescending remark. It sucks when you're pissed off at someone and they think its nothing.

I've uploaded a bunch of photos but still no gallery (quit complaining I don't feel like it right now). You can find them here;

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/oldsite/pictures2/">http://www.roborooter.com/oldsite/pictures2/</a>

Look for my <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/oldsite/pictures2/Trips/Canada/">Canada</a>, <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/oldsite/pictures2/Blackout/">Blackout</a>, and <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/oldsite/pictures2/home/Aroundtheslope/">Around Park Slope</a>, collections.

I leave you today with a photo from the black out.
