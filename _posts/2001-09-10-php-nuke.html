I'm looking at the empty Bawls bottle on my desk. Its kinda weird, makes your tongue go numb. Everyone should try <a href="http://www.nuke.roborooter.com">www.nuke.roborooter.com</a> Soon it will look like the main site and work 100% (for some reason you can't log out, I dunno why). Everyone (staff too) should make user accounts but don't get too attached to them, god knows what I'm going to have to do to fix it 100%. Also staff should email me about admin accounts. <br>I have gotten some flak about using PHP-Nuke as the site's engine but over all I think its a good move. Its going to allow users to add content and for us to make a community by removing the need to muck around small code and allowing us to make something here.  I like what it can do. <br> Oh and Bear is nasty tasting. The expensive stuff isn't any better. But umm.. I wouldn't know.. yea..<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
