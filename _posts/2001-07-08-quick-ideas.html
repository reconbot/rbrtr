I don't have constant computer access out here but I do have a few things to mention. <br>1) I'll be able to setup virtual domains quite easily for the cartoon site. I also have no problem providing web space, its just a matter of needed time. (and how his domain name will work out)<br>2) feel free to make any changes or additions to the site while I'm gone, as far as I'm concerned its as much my site as it is yours.<br>3) Never Never Never hike 3 miles up into a mountain in somebody else's borrowed sandals, if you plan to go swimming bring a backpack and keep them in there.
