I think movable type is holding me back.

Anyway while I prepare a letter I wrote to be a news post (It was an answer to the question "How do I get my site onto Google?" which I over answered at work.) Enjoy this.

I found it from a post on reddit, but apparently it was done by cartoonist <a href="http://www.claybennett.com/">Clay Bennett</a>. And I said enjoy, which means I think it's funny, but honestly I don't. I think the state of things is pretty sad when it comes to our rights to privacy I can't even goto work on time without giving the expatiation that I wont be randomly searched. Because if I <a href="http://www.flexyourrights.org/subway/">refuse to be searched</a> I have to leave the subway system. Still no legal recourse if I just enter at a different stop, that's hardly exercising your <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">4th amendment rights</a>.
