In a quest for content before I leave for 3 weeks. I fixed the staff.php (the staff links now work) It still needs some esthetic changes (hint hint I just wish someone could help me with that.... hint hint) and real staff pics and bios, but the php is finished (our good friend koudelda wrote it on a whim one day and never finished it). Well I'm off to bed, but I plan to keep things rolling until I leave on Monday.<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
