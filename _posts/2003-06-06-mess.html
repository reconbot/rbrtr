I'm currently waiting for my laundry to finish drying. I've been cleaning and throwing stuff out all day. Well, that's a lie I wasn't up all day. For some reason I woke up around 5pm. I didn't goto bed late or anything... I dunno what happened. Its almost 3am now and I have work tomorrow I need to sleep soon.

I'm happy to say I finally got my self a punchdown tool. Soon I'll be getting a toner and a probe. I've been wanting these tools for a long time. =)

My laptop broke. I woke up one morning a few days ago to find it on the floor. Must have taken out some countisubconscious aggression while I was sleeping. I don't know what to tell apple.
