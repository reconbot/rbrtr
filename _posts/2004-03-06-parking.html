So I had to park in a spot between two Suv's one of which had a ticket on it (for not moving during the alternate side parking I'd suspect). The spot was tiny and I bumped both suv's multiple times and even tried to move the one behind my car. (Thank god his bumper met my bumper instead of my taillights.) As I was parking all I could think of was my friend <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3ynad">Matt</a> telling me that in New Jersey people would pass a spot if there wasn't adequate clearance to make everyone feel comfortable. I just chuckled to my self.
