Well the raid still isn't working...

I'm kinda bumbed out about it.

Btw I don't think I've mentioned I've got a 9-5 job now.

ME <--- sold out

I've been there 3 months and I think it's working out well. It's easy work but it's constant and it pays well. And as of the other day it's paying a little weller. (Shush, it's a word today.) A paycheck isn't quite rent yet, and the state of nj decided to screw me over again, and I just paid for all this hardware that isn't working yet, and it's like... I got this money (not a lot more, but it adds up over a year) and it's still like bill'a'licious over here.

Blah..

I'm sure there are more interesting things going on in my life. But this is my blog and I 'll write what I feel like writing.

Live with it. =D
