I have so much to say, but I won't be saying it today! I'm late for my own birthday!

Here's why.

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/labs/FU/fakeimage.jpg?Now%20with%20better%20text%20support!">Roborooter's own FU image generator!</a>

That link can have any filename and any message (even blank!) and it will return a random FU image! I'm going to work on a way to encode the messages into the url so people visiting the link don't know what they're in for. Anyway, I'm off!
