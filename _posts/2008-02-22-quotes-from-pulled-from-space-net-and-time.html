<blockquote>" I see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up." - Morpheus from The Matrix</blockquote>
Repeated by <a href="http://reddit.com/user/HunterTV/">HunterTV</a> in reference to a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/358648/" alt="everything from handguns to large quantities of cocaine and marijuana">leaked RIAA training video made for US prosecutors</a>.

<blockquote>"Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But, conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that is right." -- Martin Luther King, Jr.</blockquote> Via <a href="http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Wikileaks">Wikileaks</a> who recently lost their domain name because a crooked bank who they exposed took them to court. <b>UPDATE</b>: of course as time goes on there's more to the story, they may sort of have their domain back. <a href="http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/news-as-cyberpunk/censorshit-in-amerikkka-idiot-california-judge-orders-wikileaks-offline/">The Cyberpunk review has some good coverage on this stupidness</a>.

And I'll leave this post off with a source of many good quotes.
<blockquote>"Please note, we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death. Good luck."</blockquote>
