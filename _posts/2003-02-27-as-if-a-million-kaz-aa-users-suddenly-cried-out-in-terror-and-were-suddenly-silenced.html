The origional quote from Obi-Wan is "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."<p>
Today around 1:30 4 of us gathered around my bosses computer while "flicked" our new <a href="http://www.packeteer.com/products/packetshaper/">Packeteer Packet Shaper</a>. Kaz(-)aa was pulling a whopping 11mb of data a second now only gets 1.5. Webtraffic gets priority (and then our webserves get over all of that) and then probaly the offices and then the students. (Don't quote me I don't make policy.)
Games.. I dunno - I'd rate them over file trading but thier hardly critical. What we really need (on top of this) is a better connection. But because of politics and money (plenty of budjet cuts this smester) it won't happen any time soon.<p>I'll fill you all in with my laptop woes and the wonders of my new iPod later. For now its back to work.
<p><b>NOTE:</b>I forgot to spell check and mention that our school's total connection only goes up to 20mbits (a bit less actualy but I won't go into that) I'll do them both later.
