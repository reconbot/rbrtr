Yesterday I made a photo entry to one of my favorite sites <a href="http://www.eyeswideshot.com">Eyes Wide Shot</a>. They have this 3x3 grid that each entry goes upon. You get 9 240x180 photos to work with and a title. You can either goto their site (I'm on the main page today but eventually you'll have to look through the archives.) or click the link below.

<a href="/archives/images/eyeswideshot/1.html" onclick="window.open('/archives/images/eyeswideshot/index.html','popup','width=750,height=570,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">My home of late</a>
