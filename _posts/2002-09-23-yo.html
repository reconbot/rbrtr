My laptop works... but its got a white glow in the bottom right corner and the hard drive is going to die - I know this because it told me. "Whiinneee whiiiinnee whiiineee" Not the best noise for one to make eh?
<p>School's good - but I fear that I'll never actually do anything in engineering clinic. Today we took another survey and got back last weeks. Last weeks survey was actually useful. It was to determine what types of learners we are so they could pair us up in effective well balanced groups. Unfortunately the spread was so thin it didn't matter. (We're all the same - which is kind of unique...)
<p>I need to go study... something about being an expert on Poland... dunno.
