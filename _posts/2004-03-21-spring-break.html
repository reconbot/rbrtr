So I'm back. A week later and few dollars richer. I've decided that I can't wake up in the morning while in NYC. I've got an 18 year habbit of not sleeping at night in that city and while I tried quite hard, I could not break it. Thank god I have more luck here. (When I'm not up at this hour.)

I spent most of the week sleeping, I was going to say working but I slept through most of it. I did get a good 2 days worth in and got the cash to prove it. The only thing I'm stuck with is not knowing how to properly delete old backups automatically. A little shell script would do what I want but I was to tired to figure it out, and its probably not the best way to do things either.

On tuesday I got to spend a little time with Steff but I had to fight American Idol for it. American Idol is possibly the biggest waste of air time on TV, but I could be wrong that mob of midgets vs. and elephant thing was pretty crappy. I hate Fox more then Matt Groening.

Thursday I got sick because of some ill placed (and by placed I mean in my stomach) olives. But before my almost puking out an ill made hamburger (the burger was fine but it didn't happen to be what I ordered) and a few olives I attended <a href="http://www.fatcatjazz.com/">Fat Cat Billards</a> which also happens to be a happening Jazz club.

I loved the musicians. I'm proud to say that the trumpet has become my favorite jazz instrument. The sounds that thing can make is awesome. It wasn't about the sound, jazz never is, its about the emotions that the musician is conveying threw their music. I don't think this bunch would ever be that expressive with anything else, not speech, not body language, nothing.

They also had a guest play with them. I can't remember his name to save my life. But he was a drummer and he played more naturally then he walked or talked. <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/entity.php?id=732">Click for more on Fat Cat Billiards</a>

Friday I drove 40 miles to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> in Scarsdale NY. It was a good movie, I need to see it again under different circumstances when I've got less on my mind but I grasped enough of what <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442109/">Kaufman</a> was thinking when he made it to make this viewing worth my while. If you don't know I've got a thing for his movies. He's probably one of the weirdest writers out there and thats why I think he's one of the best (Reference <a href="http://www.theicarusproject.net/purpose.php">The Icarus Project</a> to see why being weird is a dangerous gift. Note: deserves a post on its own.) I haven't seen all his movies yet (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is next in my Netflix Queue.) but Adaptation, Being John Malkovich and Human Nature (which is odd) have all turned out to be worth the $11.50. (Yes folks New York City is a rip off.) I've left each movie feeling confused, dazed, sad, happy, or in love. And each time impressed. As I said I've got a thing for his movies.

After the movie we went to a diner and spouted movie quotes. I had some interesting things I wanted to discuss about the movie. But I was quickly informed that I shouldn't try to have a discussion. (Its been a long time since any of my friends turned down intellectual conversation.) so I joined in on the movie quotes. A few funny ones were said but in the end I was left hung up on wanting to convince people that a gag movie (Jay and Silent Bob Strikes back) wasn't better then a Mislabeled Comedy (Its drama: Chasing Amy). It may have been more funny but it had no story. And being funny, while fun, gets old really fast. I can only laugh at "Cock Knocker" so many times. Which is totally alright because gags aren't meant to last for ever.

I need to <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/eternal_sunshine.html">watch</a> "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" again so I can figure out what I was thinking the first time I saw it and maybe talk with people about it.

I went home that night in a poor mood, I guess I wasn't looking to drive so much for so little. I had originally planned to see it that morning in a local theater with someone I could talk to, but she couldn't make it.

Saturday I slept a lot (much needed) and then fixed things, packed (forgot a shirt I bought and really liked and a flashlight - hoping to receive them in the mail soon), fixed things at my parents house and then went home. I did get to say hi to my ever interesting aunt who I should visit sometime soon.

As if I needed an excuse to flee to Seattle for a week or two. ;-)

Its 'wayy' past when I wanted to goto sleep, I would have gone to sleep hours ago but a friend I hadn't seen in a while showed up and I went on a diner run with them. (Stupid friends working the night shift and never sleeping EVER.)

I'm glad I'm home. Even if this apartment is only going to be home for a few more months. (We're all moving out if you didn't know.) My most promising new home is a couple's apartment. The couple are friends of Josh's and they have a room mate moving out (going to germany or something odd). I don't know them yet, nor do they know me but I'm told they're nice people. Because I don't know how that will pan out I'm still on the look out for 2-3 bedroom apartments and people who will want to live there. I shouldn't have too much of a problem with that, especially since I plan on living on campus until I meet enough people that I can find 2-3 financially backed, sane room mates. I know its a tall order but I'm feeling hopeful.

I'm sleepy (by far) so I'm sleeping. Good night.
