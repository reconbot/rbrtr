So I went and got 2 new shirts and a calculous book this morning. I'd buy another shirt if they had it in red instead of <a href="http://www.oldnavy.com/asp/Product.asp?wdid=100440&wpid=213274">"rust"</a>.

I'm going to spend the rest of the day working on Symbolic Logic (If I could get the dam <a href="http://users.rowan.edu/~bigaj/calendar.html">homework site</a> to load.) and at 3 I'll be viewing my new apartment with the owner and 2 prospective room mates.

I'm also about to go get a haircut. My <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Francis&id=DSCN3595">hair</a> has gotten a little out of control for my tastes. I'll have to see how short I get it cut.

This is for Nina, may her legacy live for as long as that white board does.

I'm heading back out for a hair cut and study time. Oh and don't forget the <a href="http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/%7Egcerbus/WhiteStripes/2001-11-23%20Vera%20Groningen/08%20-%20I%27m%20Finding%20it%20Harder%20to%20be%20a%20Gentleman.mp3">White Stripes</a>. I could jam to their music all day. I think I will.
