When I got DSL it took 6 weeks. It was slow and latent and if it didn't blow dial-up access out of the water it would have hardly been worth the trouble. I ended up changing providers, modems, speeds, and locations before ending up with my Earthlink connection at 1.5mbit/s downstream and about 80kbits up.<br>I got cable Internet from time warner in two days. I get 2mbits a second down and about 1mbit up, on a bad day.<br>I'm back from vacation and I'm tying up loose ends before school starts. Expect PHP-Nuke to be installed as soon as MySQL woes are straitened out.
