<img src="/images/blake.jpg" align="left" />Just a short message from the (ha ha) Content Director, here... If there were actual people seeing this it might matter, but whatever. Anyway, I cleaned up some of the older news on this page (failure to follow the conventions of standard written english, mostly) and dropped a bit of despair and cynicism off for you. Francis is very proud that his downloads page is now up. I'm the one who wrote those descriptions, so they will remain sketchy until I actually see the movies. Content is coming...<br>-<a href="mailto:rooney@roborooter.com">Rooney</a>
