<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/">La Vita Ë bella</a> or Life is Beautiful is a wonderful movie. I saw it on sunday which happened to be <a href="http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/holocaust/">Holocaust Remembrance Day</a> so it was fitting. The story is about... a boy. He's really a man, a goofy, amazing one named <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000905/">Guido Orefice</a> but he's a boy at heart. Not that he's young and irresponsible but he loves life and he's fun, knows how to make the most out of a situation. He <i>really</i> knows how to make the most out a situation. Watching it made me really happy.

The movie is also about another boy, Guido and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000971/">Dora</a>'s kid <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0134493/">GiosuÈ</a>. He's 4 during the movie and doesn't know about Nazis, prison camps, racism all he knows is his father and what he tells him.

So Guido tells his son the whole camp is part of a game to win a tank. They'll need 1000 points to win and they need to do stupid stuff to get points. And since everyone wants to win everyone will try to trick him into thinking its not a game. And for the most part Guido's deception works and his son is saved the horrors of the concentration camp.

This movie made me cry at the end. I'm not one to cry from a movie. It's also worth noting that Roberto Benigni (Guido) is one of two of the the only actors to have directed themselves in Oscar winning performances and that he is the first actor to win a Best Actor Oscar for a non-English speaking role.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DCES/qid=1082434196/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-6432952-2471919">Soundtrack</a> is available at Amazon.com and is "sweet and melodic".
