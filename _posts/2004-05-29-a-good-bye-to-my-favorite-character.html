I just finished watching The Sopranos. Last weeks episode (I've got HBO in-demand - but I download them anyway - the in-demand stuff doesn't work half the time ) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005576/">Adriana La Cerva</a> died. I... can't even express how sad her story is. I wish I could. It deserves to be told.
