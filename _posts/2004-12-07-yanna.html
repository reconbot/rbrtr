My friend Yana left a few months ago (2 I think) to goto California. Well the other night I got a text message. Not only did she make it to California, but she got a dog. (Hopefully named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004W52L/104-5568419-7553509?v=glance">Kerplunk</a>.) She's doing well and is missed. =)
