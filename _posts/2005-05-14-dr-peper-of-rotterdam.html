<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/">Jackie Chan</a>'s movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127357/">Who am I?</a> is one of Jackie's best. Now mind you.. he makes bad movies, but they're a lot of fun. I'd pick this one way over something like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288045/">The Medallion</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290095/">The Tuxedo</a>.

The best part (Jason just pointed this one out.) is that a "Dr. A. Peper" from Rotterdam is given thanks in the credits. I think he's the mayor or something.

I could have cracked up for hours over that.

<a href="http://www.freenewyork.net/dpfaq.html#q1.1">Dr. Pepper</a> should not be confused with <a href="http://www.parlement.com/9291000/modulesf/g0zwnzja?n=02901">Dr. A Peper</a>. While one is a nice "tart" drink, the other is a man I know nothing about. Please don't try drinking the man or expect the drink to run the city of Rotterdam.
