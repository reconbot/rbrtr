Anita and Matt were over at rowan radio tonight and were playing "Double Shots" (2 songs by the same artist in a row). Well Anita (being a DJ) was and Matt was helping out best he could. In fact he called me to ask about the band JET. (I once left a JET CD over at his house so he knows I like the group.) I recommended the second song to play "Roll over DJ" (the first song was their big single "Are you going to be my girl?") and after playing it Anita mentioned me on the radio!

It made my night =D
