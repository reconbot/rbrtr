<img src="/images/elbow.jpg" align="right" />I found out that my arm pain recently is not because its badly bruised. I have a hairline fracture in my elbow. I waited a few days hoping the pain would go away (I'd not rather panic and go to the hospital every time I hurt myself) but it didn't, so I went to a doctor and got an X-ray. I'm now the proud owner of a cast. I can hardly wait for the 3 weeks that I need to keep this thing on me to end. At least it doesnt hurt much. <br>(not actually my arm --->) <br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
