I got a Kitten, his name is <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/Alex">Alex</a>. He's quite a kid he is. He's about 7 weeks old.

I just found out that <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/catsammy">Sammy</a> died. I lived with her at my old apartment. She was really nice, a lovely cat.

I was offered Alex about two weeks ago (probably exactly two weeks by the time I hit save on this post.) by Jenny, who was given him by a Local Vet, who received him from a 10 year old boy who found him in Queens.

He was named after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108921/">Alex Mack</a> who was a girl, but to be fair when I named him I thought he was a girl. That's what I was told when I got him and I had no reason to dispute it until the vet told me otherwise.

It's nice having having a cat around, he's good.

PS Yes I know this is a mediocre post for all the inactivity lately. I've been working a lot, getting out a bit sorta. I'll write more next time.
