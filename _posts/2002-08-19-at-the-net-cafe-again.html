The guy here (Nick and I are the only other people) just turned on his "Underground Dance" music channel. =p
<p>I'm liking these Cable cars. I just uploaded some pictures from Armstrong Woods. It has trees there over 1500 years old. On a side note, that remixed Elvis song (A Little Less Conversation) just started playing. More later.
