I was writing an email to my mother about different backup methods (I kid you not) and I thought some of it was useful. And before anyone says hardlinks or rsync, I know, I know. It's just there isn't any really good way to do that on windows and I'll take incremental drive images over 100,000 file hardlinks and rsyncs. I swear I'm going to run out of innodes before I run out of hard drive space.
