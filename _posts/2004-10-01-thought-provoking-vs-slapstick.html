So like... <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/newline/freddy_vs_jason/freddy_vs_jason_480.mov">Emily Vs. Brian</a>, or something to that effect.

The point is, Brian gets more comments. And I hate to say its because people are lazy but... yea people are lazy. It's easier to respond to something stupid then to something that makes you think.

(Frank keeps asking "What's with your friends?")

But I understand you, you're suffering from malnutrition, sleep depravation, undue stress, and your lazy. It's ok though, I'm those things too.
