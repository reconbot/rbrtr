Now I normally don't like posting flash video, espicially not from other sites. In a few years I bet this video wont work and this post will be a lot less useful. But I did want to share one take on the Florida delegate situation and share <a href="http://www.moblogic.tv">MobLogic.tv</a>. The show basically takes to the streets and asks the general public about what they think is going on with regards to a myriad of issues. The host Lindsay Campbell came over from <a href="http://www.wallstrip.com">Wallstrip</a> which is another show that I quite like. She wasn't that big into stocks so after the show was bought up by CBS I guess she found herself an outlet with a better fit.
