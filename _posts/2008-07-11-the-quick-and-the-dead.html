<sub>Dreamhost decided to revert my database back to just before I finished this post, effectively unpublishing it and returning the rest of my typos. I thankfully left it open in a browser on my laptop. So this post is now amazing, not because it's any good, but because it survived being put down like a sick dog. It gets to live.</sub>

I'm on hold trying to straiten out 3 of 4 billing snafus companies have me in. The first two were easy, this one <a href="http://www.Broadvoice.com" target="_blank">Broadvoice</a> is just not answering their phones and I can't get into their website. They do my business phone line and they can suck it.

I'll call them back later, Next up is Sprint who's been charging me for insurance even though I'm not eligible. This exact thing happened the last time I lost my phone. I figured they messed up and insured me anyway, and I was able to get a 3rd replacement phone, but only because they continued to charge me after I wasn't eligible. Don't ask about the other two, but the 3rd phone was lost at a concert. Oh.. faithless was worth it... but maybe not if they didn't replace my phone for $50 bucks. They made it very clear that they were being nice and I'd have to wait a long long while to be eligible for insurance again. (A year or two?) So while there's a chance I'm currently eligible, I haven't been all this time and they never stopped charging me.

Which allows me to convolutedly tie this all back to the title of this post and the very excellent movie.

<strong>The Quick and the Dead</strong>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114214/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-631" title="Guess which ones were quick and which ones are dead." src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/0572345100.jpg" alt="The Quick and the Dead Cast" width="320" height="400" /></a>

<strong>Quick Story Overview</strong>

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-632" title="Gene Hackman and his wicked henchmen" src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/quick00.gif" alt="Gene Hackman and his wicked henchmen" /> Gene Hackman is a misundersood former bandit who's given up his life of crime and settled in a failing town. He's taken over and provided it with a thriving entertainment industry. The problem is people in the town are bitter about his violent past and want to steal his money. They hire quick draw assassins to take him out so they can take his former ill gotten gains for themselves. This of course has made Gene Hackman paranoid and he has hired bodyguards to protect him and vital town locations like where he keeps his money, the clock tower, and the saloon.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-633" title="Leo!" src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/quick03.gif" alt="" width="247" height="375" />He even lets his son Leonardo DiCaprio run the local gun store. They have a strained relationship but what father and son has never gone though a rough patch? Eventually Sharon Stone shows up and convinces them to fight to the death. They both die. The end.

Nah Most of that is lies. I'm really good at reciting movies, but I have to tell you it's a lot more fun to make shit up. The movie is good, really good. It’s a western about Sharon Stone coming back to avenge her father and most of the movie she’s like this;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634" title="Sharon Stone is Awesome" src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/quick07.gif" alt="Sharon Stone is Awesome" width="350" height="236" />

And then at the end she suddenly becomes the 80s;

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-635" title="Sharon Stone is awkward with lots of hair." src="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/quick06.gif" alt="Sharon Stone is awkward with lots of hair." width="350" height="235" />

Which doesn’t break the movie, but not growing up watching Sharon Stone movies confused me a little. Apparently her hair is her <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/153sirs.jpg">thing</a>.

Umm so Gene Hackman is a twisted baddass and makes everyone fight to the death because he runs things, has henchmen, and is an ass hole. I bring this up because if me and Sprint where in this town, I’d gladly shoot them in the chest a few times.

Everyone (who matters anyway) is a baddass in this film. I’ll leave you with that remark a picture of Russel Crow. Oh and <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.thequickandthedead.net');" href="http://www.thequickandthedead.net/">this guy</a> was part of the film and really enjoyed it.

<sub>And now to go back to dealing with Sprint.. I really posted this so I didn’t have to look at that god dammed stupid cover of 21 dog years whenever I looked at my site.</sub>
