I'm still coming to terms with how wordpress deals with tagging. I think they're stuck between categories and tags and they need to drop one (categories) as they are basically the same thing and usability suffers with too many options.

To aid in my tagging I got a wordpress plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> which lets me see all my previous used tags when choosing tags for a new post. (Which is genuinely useful!) It's also got a bunch of things I don't want or need. Like auto tagging, and suggesting tags. I thought I'd play with them though.

The suggested tags for my post on the <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/post/630/the-quick-and-the-dead/">Quick and the Dead</a> were: Movies, gene hackman, story overview, life of crime, assassins, ill gotten gains, entertainment industry, and <strong>typos</strong>.

Fuck you yahoo!
