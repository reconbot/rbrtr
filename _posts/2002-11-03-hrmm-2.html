I do have mono.<br>Only 1 in 3 people who are exposed mono's virus develop mono, it takes 30-60 days after
infections to show symptons, after recovery (2 weeks to 2 months if your not carefull) you still have the virus
for 30days to 18 months. Its a sneaky virus.<p>I have sucessfully registered for my crappy schedule. The
stupid mock schedule maker had the wrong 5 digit call number for the class. Gah - BTHSNEWS.org is in trouble.
Got to run.
