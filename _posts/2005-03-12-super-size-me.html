Alright...

So I learned some things from <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/">Super Size Me</a>. (Available at any video rental store. And under documentaries on Showtime In Demand Specials.) The pretence. Morgan Spurlock a healthy man eats Mc. Donnalds

Eating <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonnalds</a> every day for a month is really really bad for you.

He gained 12 pounds in first 10 days.

Eating will make you feel good too.

That's not news. I've got a small weight problem, I weigh... 206 last time I checked. I don't have a scale so I don't have to know todays weight. I don't really need to, I can tell if I've been eating too much, I can feel it. Food tastes good. (Usually) Pizza, pasta, hamburger, chicken. Heck, tomato sauce too. I love these things, the flavors on the mouth, the taste on the tongue and the instant satisfaction of a full belly. It's addictive. And why not? Food is supposed to make us feel good isn't it?

When your not eating, you'll feel bad.

When you don't eat healthy, you feel bad when your not eating. This guy got headaches as bad as migraines between meals. He was tired all the time, stopped being able to walk up the stairs to his apartment easily, and felt like crap, often. When he was eating he felt great, it was good to get some food into him. When he wasn't on food he was depressed.

Other common effects from eating too much are Hypertension (75% of people can stop taking their hypertension medication after eating less, unfortunately these statistics came from a surgeon that specializes in reducing peoples stomachs to the size of baseballs.),  high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease.


The Surgeon General says 30 minutes of exercise a day is required to maintain a steady body weight. That's 1/48th of a day it's not a lot. I know that the steps for me to loose weight are simple. 1) Eat less, 2) Move more. That's it. But that's me, I should be able to drop 10 pounds in a couple weeks. I hope anyway. I mean I feel like I should be able to, I've lost weight before.

Other fun facts.

Children watch 3000 hours of food commercials a year. Parents eating every meal of every day with their children get around 1000 hours a year. So even if you enforced healthy eating and educated them

He gained 24 pounds in 30 days, his BMI went from %12 to %21, his liver hardened... His doctor said it was like he was on a drinking binge and if he didn't stop drinking he end up dying.

It took him 4 months to loose most of the weight (10-20 pounds, I forget) and then another 9 to lose the remaining.

So I finished watching this and I think back to the other night when Andrew, Jason and I were hanging out. (As they read this they're going "Oh no...") We were hungry, it was late and none of us had really eaten much that day. So after spending some time at Home Depot we went to <a href="http://www.whitecastle.com/">White Castle</a>. We were filled with <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/cameradump/DSCN0035">Regret</a> afterwards. I mean it was tasty at first, but... we all felt sick later. I never want to do that again.

(After Morgan's first supersized Big Mac meal (1st or 2nd day of the movie) he threw up out the side of his car.)
