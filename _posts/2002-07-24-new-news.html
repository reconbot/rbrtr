I updated the pictures script so it now makes uniform sized thumbs. I also got a new camera, so if your a thug in your mid twenties, live in Cali, and would like a camera, you might want to keep your eyes open for me. I'm going to Cali the 15th of August for 2 weeks. Should be fun. I'm also really liking my new camera. It's not broken like the old one and it makes really huge pictures. (The ones in the "fun_with_my_new_camera" section are almost a meg each.) Um... yea.. Check by <a href="http://www.opiniononline.org/">OpinionOnline.org</a> later; you might find something you like.
