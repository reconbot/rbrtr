I wanted to email Leo Laporte but he gets too much email. So I figured I'd make it an open email and then twitter about it. Talk about a backhanded way to get someone's attention, but I guess when you're as popular as he is you can only do so much.
<blockquote>Leo,
I was playing with some audio processing tools with a friend and we loaded up your latest twit and saw this. Did you know your intro looked so cool? That's crazy!

On a side note, you can see this for yourself with iPhone app (and I know how you love these) called Spectrograph Lite. You can kind of see the same swigglies that sound so cool.

Enjoy your shows, keep up the good work.
