I'm personaly doing fine. But... I just have 6 words for you.<p>
<center><a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=13350">CIA Special Agent DR. LEX LUTHOR.</a></center><p>
I'm going to fucking cry. Their going to kill Superman. Not kill him
like "Doomsday" did. Not kill him like any villan has tried before. They
are going to make people hate superman. This *movie* while looking cool,
having amazing action sequences, and cool charecters is NOT in anyway
shape or form what Superman really is. I meen Krypton doesn't even
fucking explode.
