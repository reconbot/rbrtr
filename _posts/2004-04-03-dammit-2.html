I just realized that my pack of 25 DVD-R's are actually DVD-RW's and they are teh suck.

On a plus note, I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/">Hellboy</a> today. The movie wasn't phenomenal but I defiantly have respect for the <a href="http://www.hellboy.com/z-old-design/index.html">Comic</a>. I also discovered <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579/">Ron Perlman</a> who does the voice and plays for many cartoon characters and evil villains alike. He also played as hellboy.

Sarah lent me her Godhead cd today. Best band I ever forgot that I liked. Read on for the lyrics of "I hate today". I'm not sure I'm going to put lyrics on the main page anymore, I realized that unless you know why I'm doing it you're not going to care about them. So I won't subject anyone to lyrics unless they really want them. (And yes I will probably continue to be cryptic about why I'm posting them.) Don't worry folks I don't hate today, I'm just posting this song because I like it and its been a long time since I last heard it.

I Hate Today by Godhead
2000 Years of Human Error

Slowly he settles down to give them what they want
He tries to keep himself together
I would slam my head in the ground before I tell you this
He turns his head to the floor as it falls away

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today

You taught me everything you know
The blame will surely show, ya
I try to keep it down forever

Days have taken years
To conquer all my fear
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut-down

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today
