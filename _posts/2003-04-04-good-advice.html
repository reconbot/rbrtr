I started taking Paxil 3 days ago. Apparently I'm depressed or something, I dunno. If it helps it helps. But its kept my stomach pretty upset (side effects) I can barely eat anything.<p>In other news someone locked
the student center's back doors (the main ones) on april fools day and put up signs saying that the entrance was under repair and that students should use the other side. It was funny watching people walk away.<p>And in final thoughts <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/january2/neversleepwalkalone.html">never sleep walk alone</a>.
