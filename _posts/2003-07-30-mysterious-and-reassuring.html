Why do I feel like instantly crying when someone is hurt or lost on television or in the stories I read? I feel like crying out when someone is about to do something stupid. "He's wearing a wire!" when Tony Soprano is talking to the snitch from season one. "The bridge is going to collapse!" when a character from one of my favorite tv shows is about to run over it to escape capture from the general bad guys.

But after it happens, they live, they die, either way. I almost instantly snap back and move on. I guess because it generally doesn't matter in the end. Its only stories.
