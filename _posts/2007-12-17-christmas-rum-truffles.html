I got this from a prostitute. (<a href="http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html#8076462860796766573">Yes really</a>.) I hope I have time to try it out this year.

<blockquote>Christmas Rum Truffles

INGREDIENTS
150g (5 oz) dark chocolate
2 tablespoons of dark rum
150ml (ยฌยบ pint) double cream
24g (1 oz) butter
The peel from 1 orange
2 cloves

2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon of plain flour
1 tablespoon of cocoa powder
toasted nuts (optional)

1. Break up the chocolate and melt in a saucepan on a low heat, along with the cream and butter, and the cloves.

2. Grate the orange peel directly into the saucepan using a cheese grater; add a squeeze of juice if you like. After a few minutes, stir in the rum and add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.

3. Keep stirring for about 3 minutes, then pick out the cloves and transfer the mixture to a bowl, and place this in the fridge overnight.

4. The next day, dust a wooden board with the flour, and sprinkle some cocoa powder and the remaining cinnamon over it too. If you're using toasted nuts, keep them on a plate nearby.

5. Take heaped teaspoons of the chilled truffle mixture and roll into small balls with your hands. Roll these in the flour/cocoa/cinnamon mixture (and then in the nuts if you like) and plop into petit-four cases.

Chill until ready to serve.</blockquote>
