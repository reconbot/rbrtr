Recently Francis and I were talking about the matrix reloaded and I clarified some things he didn't understand fully and one thing led to another and I ended up writing this post up so that more people might hear my opinion on what was happening in the matrix reloaded.<p>
As some one who has seen the matrix reloaded more then once, I have
come to think I understand some of the more complicated symbolism and confusing aspects of
the plot. Parts of my interpretation requires you to understand a bit about
computers and programs<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The first question I had about the matrix came form the first movie,
but is really answered in reloaded. That question is about predetermination and
how did the oracle know the future? Now the answer to the question actually
comes form an idea that was first suggested by Isaac Newton, which is if we
knew the direction and velocity of every particle in the universe then we would
be able to predict the rest of time. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Now this won't work in real life be cause of some very good reasons
that I won't go into here, but the matrix is a computer program and by the very
nature of computer program it's very easy to know what they are going to do.
(Now here comes the math and computer knowledge) programs are made of
functions. Now for those of you that don't remember about functions, by definition a
function will have only one answer for any set of variable (and example might be
Y=3X+5 or Y=3Z+4X -12). And that is true for all programs, you input variable
A and get answer B. So as long as the matrix works right you can take the
current state of thing (like a rock falling) and predict what will happen (it
will hit something) But also in this lies a problem. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      And this leads us to my second question about the matrix reloaded.
What was the "architect" talking about? When he said that the first matrix
failed, that there was a flaw, and that the intuitive program solved that problem?
Well now to understand that you have to go to one of the major themes of the
matrix, chose. That is why the first matrix failed. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Humans aren't programs, they are not functions, with a human if you
input a set of variable and you might get a different answer to what you have
gotten before. This is because the human mind is build on a concept alien to
programs, chose. And since humans are acting as part of a program they MUST act
like functions. This is why the oracle says "you have already made the chose
now you must understand it". While put like this it is confusing what she is
actually saying is "when you have the input of 2 and 3 you make 5 now you  must
understand why you make 5"(it's addition by the way) she is trying to make him
understand that in the matrix chose is deeply suppressed. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     And how is it suppressed? That is a complicated question. I think it
lays in the subconscious, in belief. That is your only chose is to
subconsciously belief in the matrix or not. And one you have that chose you don't need any
others. The architect's statement supports this, that once the chose not to
believe was added, the matrix worked. But he also infers that this was just a
temporary fix that ultimately it did not solve all the problems. Now I have to
warn you my next conclusion is a bit hard to understand and may just make you
more confused, but if you get what I'm about to write you will understand how
neo stopped the sentinels. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The architect's statements infer that once the element of chose was int
roduce to grows, and remember what Morpheus said " we have freed more minds
in the past 6 mouths then in the last 6 years". What this means that the longer
humans have to chose, more will chose not to believe. This is why Zion must
be destroyed this is why "the system must be purged of the code". You see
because people in Zion must believe also. This is because they are still part of
the program, they are still in matrix. Zion, the ships, the whole resistance is
just part of the program, another control. This is why the architect didn't
want "the ultimate flaw to reveal it's self". The flaw was neo seeing he was
still in a computer, that he could just stop the sentinels with his mind like the
bullets he freezes in air. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      This leaded down a deeper whole, and asks more questions. Like "is the
war real?" and"are machines and AIs our enemy?"  But we really can't answer
these questions right now. So I'm just going to stop here and leave the rest up
to debate and maybe some one else will figure it out.<p>
