I'll rewrite this post when I'm more educated. The heightened "random" security restrictions on air travel bothers me immensely. We can now more then ever be restricted from travel for any reason. I'm waiting to hear 3rd party candidates delayed from attending rallies. (There's a story from Russia to this effect.)

I'm angry, but I'm even more angry that it doesn't matter how angry I am.
