I got a Toaster Oven for $5 at the Goodwill store. I don't know if everyone knows this but I've been wanted a toaster oven for a long time. Its like an oven with the convenience of a toaster. I can now make my toasted sandwiches with out having to heat up an entire oven!

Its like this one but has one dial for time and nothing else.

And while I may be pleased as punch I'm not quite as proud as this lady.
