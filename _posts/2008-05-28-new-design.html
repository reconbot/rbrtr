I've been developing this site for a few days using wordpress and some plugins. I've hacked out a decent looking theme and made it more mine. You don't need to register to comment and your comments should show up now. (Some, a few actually as I asked around got caught up in spam filtering and I didn't even see them.) Also if you have an openID your comment should go through immediately. Until spammers start using it anyway.

Andrew gave me a neat idea for the header. Never mind I already did a lot of work for what's up there, I'm going to try something out to make it a little more interesting.  

I also need to integrate the gallery into it again. My old robot isn't a random gallery image. ;-)

Let me know what you think.
