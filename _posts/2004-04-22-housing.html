Well our fucking landlord wanted to up the rent to $360 per person (didn't matter who was living there). With the same for the security deposit. If he didn't want us living there he should have said something and not pulled this bull shit. Tomorrow I'm going to see if there are offices I can visit to make sure I got all the facts strait. But to be honest I'm going there because he's not treating us like tenants, he's treating us like children.

I wish I had some comps in the area, I bet a quick call could figure out how much comparable buildings are.

Bottom line, I don't like the way he's treating me and my room mates. I just wanted a garden!

I did get that <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/people/Francis/DSCN3599.jpg.html">hair cut</a> today and it doesn't look half bad. I kept my hair a bit longer then my normal "I don't know what I looked like before so just cut most of it off" cut. But its oh so much shorter then what I had before.

I like taking upside-down pictures of my self, they seem to come out better.
Almost as good as <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/Francis/swivel.mov">swiveling</a> in my chair.


I'll leave you today with the lyrics to a beautiful song that Sarah found. I suggest you go find someone with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000003JO1/qid=1082612390/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl15/104-6432952-2471919?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Sew True</a> album and listen to the song your self.

Breathe into my hands are cupped
and like a glass to drink from;
Are you still,
still breathing.
Are you still,
breathing.
Are you still,
still breathing.
Are you still,
breathing.
Breathe into my hands are cupped
and like a glass to drink from...
