"We're big, we're pink and we'll be on your right."

<a href="http://www.frontalot.com/">MC Frontalot</a> is an indy rapper who spawned the <a href="http://www.frontalot.com/music.html">Nerd Core Hip Hop</a> movement... everywhere. He's probably the only one fronting these indie rhymes and funky beats. In fact he's so indie that his shirt don't fit.

I mean, he makes me wonder out loud, 'frontalot yo why you come so ill-equipped?'

I'll see you there?

Yea =D
