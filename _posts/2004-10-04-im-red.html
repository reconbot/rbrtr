<img src="http://images.quizilla.com/A/Aliteinthesky/1057725487_CMyDocumentsred.gif" border="0" alt="HASH(0x892a71c)"><br>You are the color red.  You are the most<br>controversial of all the colors.  You are often<br>easily angered, but as easily as you got<br>excited, you come down.  When angered, do you<br>have the tendency to be malicious?  Afterwards,<br>do you end up begging for forgiveness?  Maybe.<br>But you're incredibly generous, and, odd<br>enough, needy.  You love to hate, and<br>sometimes, you hate to love.  This color<br>describes you as generally edgy.  When in a bad<br>situation, you're pessimistic, and when you're<br>in a good situation, you're extremely<br>optimistic.  You're painfully tempermental, and<br>sometimes it hurts the ones you love.  But with<br>an exciting and stimulating attitude, you enjoy<br>talking to people and being social.  But aside<br>from your bold and outgoing attitude, you're<br>attention-needing and attention-getting.  This<br>color is associated with lust and desire--and<br>you are both lust and desirous.  You're a<br>protective person when it comes to the people<br>you love.  You're incredibly sharp-witted and<br>powerful (not to mention intelligent!).
