My good friend Andrew works with my other good friend Brian at Lazer Park in time square. You might have remembered the place as having "the largest indoor arena on the east coast". It was a lot of fun, but now after many years, it's closing. And I guess Andrew and Brian are lucky, as they get to be the ones to help dismantle it. Better the people who loved the place put it down then people who are strangers to it's futuristic armageddon motif.

Lazer Park will be missed. And you can check out andrew's <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/friendsphotos/arooney7/LP/">dismantling photos</a> and you can check out his <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/friendsphotos/arooney7/">personal gallery</a> too. Technical problems have prevented me from editing the sidebar, but there are newer galleries to look at.
