So I was having a chat with someone and they asked if I had a wishlist.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=wlem-si-html_viewall/103-9561737-8732660?id=20RQTOEOU9RE2">Francis's Wishlist</a>

That's it. But I'm also not above gadgets, toys (I love nerf guns), and land.

Thank you someone for giving me an excuse to flaunt my upcoming 21st birthday and my wishlist. I'd hate to do this unprevoked.  =D
