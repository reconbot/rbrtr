<B>"Big Eyed Fish"</b><BR><BR>
Look at this big - eyed fish swimming in the sea oh<br>
How it dreams to be a bird swoop and diving through the breeze<br>
So one day caught a big old wave up on to the beach<br>
Now he.s dead you see beneath the sea is where a fish should be<br>
<br>
But oh God<br>
Under the weight of life<br>
Things seem brighter on the other side<br>
<br>
You see this crazy man decided not to breathe<br>
He turned red and blue - purple, colorful indeed<br>
No matter how his friends begged and pleaded the man would not concede<br>
And now he.s dead you see the silly man should know you got to breathe<br>
<br>
But oh God<br>
Under the weight of life<br>
Things seem brighter on the other side<br>
<br>
Oh God<br>
Under the weight of life<br>
Things seem so much better on the other side<br>
<br>
No way, no way<br>
No way out of here<br>
<br>
You see the little monkey sitting up in his monkey tree<br>
One day decided to climb down and run off to the city<br>
But look at him now lost tired living in the street<br>
As good as dead you see what a monkey does - stay up your tree<br>
<br>
But oh God<br>
Under the weight of life<br>
Things seem brighter on the other side<br>
<br>
Oh God<br>
Under the weight of life<br>
Things seem so much better on the other side<br>
<br>
No way, no way, no way<br>
No way out of here<br>
<br>
Rain in my dreams<br>
<br>
Fall away<br></center></font>
