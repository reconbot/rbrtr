<p>For thoes of you who didn't attend my highschool shortly after
12/06/2001 probaly won't get this jab. Andrew
who happened to have been a reader of <a href="http://www.reallifecomics.com">Real Life</a> around that time and
happened to have an "epiphany" about how to make normal words sound evil. I won't claim that if I had been
reading the comic instead I could have started a 2 month inside joke for about 9 people. Andrew has a kind of
whit you don't find with too many people.
