I hope everyone has been well lately. I've been around brookly here and there. Working, sleeping, just.. I dunno being. I got a few parking tickets? I'm sorta at a loss for typing today, I've been sleeping in a lot and I can't say it helps me think.

So I'm going to go and clean out that small list of things I want to put somewhere but never managed to put anywhere so it ended up in my inbox, or in a text file on my desktop. My virtual workspace is looking a lot like my actual workspace and that's never good. Every so often (usually when I'm going to a job - but sometimes its when the mess is too much) I stick everything on my desktop into a folder to go through later. Unfortionatly out of sight == out of mind, I have 4 levels of "cleanup" folders.

I've got 5 rsvps for my birthday so far, check your email people. Or just call me I'm friendly.

Every minute, the human brain processes about 17GB of visual input, 5GB of audio input 20MB of tactile input, 350kB of olfactory input, and 100 kB of gustatory input. - <a href="http://www.gullible.info">Gullible.info</a>

(On switching to linux - written by some other guy)
As a former windows power user who transitioned completely only about a year ago, let me offer this advice:
Pick up an ubuntu cd, give it a partition, and use it more than the two minutes it takes to conclude it's not windows. Seriously. Forget windows is even there for a week. Pretend someone stole your old computer and all they left you with is this weird piece of shit doppelganger that sorta looks like your old pc, but everything's just a little "off." Accept the fact transitions are not always easy, and give this doppelganger a week of your computing life. Then go back to windows. And make sure you have some clean clothes handy, because you're going to need a shower afterward.

So take that, your calling me a dashing handsome scoundrel, when you call me a wop. Bitch.
