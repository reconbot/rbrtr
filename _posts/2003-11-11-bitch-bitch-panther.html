I just wanted to bitch that while Apple's <a href="http://www.mac.com/1/iTour/tour_backup.html">Backup</a> doesn't backup programs. Nothing ending in .app (which is the extension for programs if you didn't know) so while I saved my music, and my pictures, and thousands of files of unwanted internet cache I don't have a single program. Ohh yea, I erased my hard drive and installed Panther. That and Melissa doesn't like the toaster strudels I bought. Well she can go fuck the ducks, dam things don't have the sense to fly south.

(PS Melissa if your reading this I'm not really angry but you can go to shop right and check for your self, its all they had.)
