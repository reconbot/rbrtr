I had a good birthday. I woke up early, went to class, did errands, and now I'm going to sleep for a big test tomorrow. No wild parties with boobs and too much alcohol. I guess I'll have to wait until next year. Anyway I made out good with some DVDs and a New Computer (which I built a week ago and it still makes me drool). I also gave my self a car wash (for my car) and I left a waitress a $20 dollar tip for some ice cream. (Didn't catch her reaction though I left to soon.) I dunno... I'm happy it was a good day.

Thank you everyone who came to Liberty with me. I had a good time. =)

And I can't really believe I did this. I didn't mean it...
