I've stumbled upon a pretty cool web comic.

<a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net"><img alt="qcbannernew.png" src="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/images/qcbannernew.png" width="462" height="60" border="0" /></a>

Start at the beginning and read through them there's not that many (un)fortunately. I've gotten spoiled by watching tv shows on dvds, and finding <a href="http://www.neonwheels.com/preacher/index.shtml">Preacher</a> (thanks Sarah) after all the books had been published, because I expect to go through a season with out commercial interruption, and finish stories with out having to wait on them.

Just read a bit, it just keeps getting better. AND don't just read the last few, it won't make any sense to you!

I picked out my favorite fan art about the comic, it sums it up rather nicely. (No the main character doesn't want to be a woman.) I'll leave the finding out about  what the comic is about to you.
