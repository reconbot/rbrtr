WOOO!!! Mac version of truecrypt!

Also now you can boot your entire PC from truecrpyt! This is the first free implementation of this that I know of for windows. (I'm probably wrong.) But from what I'm reading it's really really easy to do. That is probably a first. But without waiting for your entire drive to encrypt, you can basically set it up, reboot, and it will start to encrypt everything as you continue to use your computer normally. You can even reboot (or crash!) before it finishes and it will pick up where it left off. I wonder how much this would slow your system down, and how much of a pain it would be to fix hard drive problems. I imagine it would mess with volume managers, backup software (like mozy or trueimage) and in the end whoever has to fix it (me). It's still cool, and worth playing with if you have a spare system laying around. I wouldn't tempt bootcamp with it, but I encourage anyone with vmware or parallels to goto town.
