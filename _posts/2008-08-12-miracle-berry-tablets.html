<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_fruit">Miracle fruit</a> or berries makes sour things taste sweet. An effect that apparently is quite amazing.

From the supplier's website.
<cite> The active ingredient in the Miracle Berry Fruit, known as Miraclulin coats the tongue and blocks out the taste bud receptors which are responsible for sour, bitter and acidic flavours. The outcome is that all foods which taste sour, bitter or acidic miraculously come to taste sweet.</cite>

Once I was told you could solve the problem with transporting "Miracle" berries by freeze drying them (they spoil quickly) and that you could buy said berries online for $20 dollars, I immediately bought them.

It comes with 10 pills each formerly being 3 berries. Think geek says you should cut them in half for twenty servings. The <a href="http://www.miracleberrypill.org">official supplier</a> claims that even fresh berries start loosing their effects due to age and that problem doesn't exist after it's been freeze dried.

I'm going to have to try it to find out =)
