I'm not really back yet but I have the pics all in one unsorted folder. It's about 500 or so... I'll have them organized and the crapshots removed later this week. (Also a few more were added to the mess from a friend of mine - some of his shots are here but not all of them.) I'm off to a few days at camp! =D<p>Okay I lied; none of his shots are here yet.
<p> For those new to my site (I gave a few urls out at the con) You can find the pics at the bottom of my pictures page (the link is up top) or just click <a href="/pictures.php?path=otakon">here</a> (for now) Cheers!
<p>Oh and one more thing, most of the pictures are big. Like 1mb each. I'll reduce the main bunch of them and I'd like to change my pictures script to generate a few different sizes but for now only click on pictures you really want to see.
