So I saw this on TV, and well it was scary. These two girls came out of some screaming and giggling bubble and started dancing in a field. It was some PBS HD channel with kids shows for brain dead children who haven't learned anything ever. (Kids start out blank, remember?)

But this girl on the left, she's so scary looking. I mean... I normally don't say things like this but.. she's so fucking scary. Little brain dead children watching this show at 6 am had to be crying. This scary girl dancing on TV in full HD quality, the horror.
