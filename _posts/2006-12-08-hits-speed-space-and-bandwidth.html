I've written about this before.. I should probably search for it..
And to clarify, hits means unique hits, different ips.

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/roborootercom/bandwidth_ho/">I had reported</a> that I get about 250 nique hits a day, and mostly from a video I posted. (About 4 out of 5 of the hits were for the video opposed to the main page) And so today I check back and I'm now getting on average 500 hits a day.

Why?

Well all this was prompted by me browsing my stats again (same thing happened last time) so lets give some stats.

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/archives/images/emokid.jpg">Emo Kid</a> Is posted on about 4 or 5 myspace pages. That gets me about 30-40 hits a month.
People like to hear long lists of <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/Hobo_Names.mp3">Hobo Names</a> about 30-40 of you a month.
I'm glad to see that someone found my favorite mashup of all time, the <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/music/Toxic%20Love%20Shack%20Mix.mp3">Toxic Loveshack</a> and shared it with their friends, who share it with about 20 different people a month.
That stupid <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/000514.html">car commercial</a> is still up there at 91 hits a month.

The top two requested pages are the<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/tag/cool"> "cool" archive page</a> and the <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> which is well.. unimpressive. In fact while my traffic may have doubled, now almost half of it is web robots!

So while there are more people viewing my site, I have a lot more robots visiting too. Indexing and categorizing and all sorts. And hopefully, determining that I'm just a stupid blog and only relevant to specific searches. The top search that finds roborooter is "volvo logo" followed by "ghosts" and then "emo kid". (Wtf emo kid?) I take pride in not incessantly repeating other people's posts and linking to them. Which is what most blogs seem to do these days.

The <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/">Gallery</a> should run marginally faster now, if I get some free time I'm going to try out <a href="http://eaccelerator.net/">eaccelerator</a> and compile it for <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?77225">dreamhost</a> (they run my servers) as that should give it quite a boost and make it.. well responsive. I also let google back in, I had them blocked on the IP level due to them sending my processor usage through the roof while they indexed me. But I signed up with google's webmaster services and told them to take it slow, and that my gallery need them to be sweet, kind and loving. Otherwise it will freak out and I'll get emails saying I'm using too much of the processor. Also the pages get cached now, but they have to be visited at least once to cache and since there are so many pictures, when google indexs me it hits thousands of pictures and generates a cache for each one. So when you go to visit that <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/friendsphotos/sarahd/fall2003/stormwandering/DSCN2987.jpg.html">obscure photo</a> later you'll get the cache and it will load faster and not use much processor, but it doesn't protect from google until next time.

I also continue to have plenty of bandwidth and server storage to spare (thanks to dreamhost). I think I'm gonna try making another gimic site (I had a link exchange for Kings of Chaos a while back. But I'm officially retiring that today.) maybe "am I shoopdawoop or not" or something...

Anyway thanks for partaking in another one of my meandering "Francis dumps his mind" posts. No plan, no process, just writing. Just like they taught me in school. (I'm swear to god.)
