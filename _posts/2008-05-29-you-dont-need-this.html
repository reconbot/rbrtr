I got a small pack of stickers from <a href="http://antiadvertisingagency.com/projects/you-dont-need-it-stickers-2">The Anti-Advertising Agency</a>. A guy named <a title="Steve Lambert" href="http://antiadvertisingagency.com/author/admin/">Steve Lambert</a> made them and he'll give some out to anyone who asks and sends them an envelope. All he asks is that you send him some photos of your work.

All photo credits (she's much better with cameras that aren't cell phones) goto Caroline, who's website is forthcoming.
