<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=91632&cid=7884155">I was reading.</a> And its the reason why I got up at 8am this morning when my alarm went off instead of hitting snooze a couple of times.

(Going to bed around midnight helped too. In fact its probably the biggest reason. I'd hate to have to get up at 6am and have to goto bed at 10pm. I'm glad I don't.)

If you are having problems getting up, then DON'T USE SNOOZE!

You are just training yourself in a bad habit - "Don't need get up. Go sleep more. Noise not important".

Instead, put whatever you use to awaken yourself out of reach of the bed - preferably on the other side of the room. MAKE yourself get up and walk over to the alarm to turn it off. Then, KEEP MOVING - go fix your coffee or whatever you do when you get up.

Speaking of coffee - should you be an imbiber of morning caffinated hot beverages, invest in a timer controlled coffee pot. Set it to start about 10 minutes before your alarm goes off. Put it in a place where the aroma of brewing coffee (or whatever) will reach you.

Most people are training themselves to be insomniacs - watching TV or reading in bed, staying up to catch that "gotta see it" show instead of sleeping when they are tired, hitting snooze in the mornings. Beds should be used for two things only - sleep and sex. Anything else should be done elsewhere.

I trained myself to go to sleep within minutes of hitting the bed in college, when I had Calc II at 7:30 and my next class was at 10:30 - go to calc, go back to room, sleep some more, then go to chemistry. I refined this when I was working 80 hours a week at my first job - go home over lunch, catch a 30 minute powernap, then back to work. As I understand it, this is also what the various military services train you to do - "Don't stand if you can sit. Don't sit if you can lie down. If you can lie down, go to sleep."
