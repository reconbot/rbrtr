<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/404.thisisnotreallyit">404</a>? no! I finished my last final project!

I haven't Showered, or Shaved, or Changed since I started this thing 3 days ago. I want to play City of Heros! But I want to be clean a whole lot more. I also need to get josh melissa's rent (she's good for it) in cash so it clears before our rent check.

I'm done!

btw if your ever programing in java and you get a problem with serialization give up right away. Its not worth it.

Java makes a much better coffee.
