I've met so many good and nice people over the past few days I can hardly believe there is still one more to go. I want to thank the presenters (even the girl who had the Zuse room before me who had trouble with her crowd), I want to thank TELEPHREAK and GiD for the projector, and all the people who learned something from me today. (Including those two drunk couples on the train home. I couldn't have hoped for a better response to my cards.) I can't tell you how good it feels to teach something again.

And I'm even invited to a dinner tomorrow night, chemists make wonderful chefs.

PS Oh and you better belive I've got a backlog of stuff to share.
