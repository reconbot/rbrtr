I'm going to throw a lot of random quotes out here, don't take them all to heart.

I visited Rowan University. This past weekend I drove the 110 miles it takes to get from <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.adp?go=1&do=nw&un=m&2tabval=address&cl=EN&ct=NA&1tabval=address&1y=US&1a=&1c=&1s=&1z=11215&1ah=&2y=US&2a=&2c=&2s=&2z=&2ah=sAw9etKb4M5MS2tHWzKrgcjByWNaN0AOAiFfYncwZbp6ZlNhuWHHzJjDVqfZikV7XpC%252fbjXxKslrh4flJOalyk2qPJ4gGhSC&idx=0&id=413d4cb5-00394-05aaf-cdbcf394&aid=413d4cb5-00395-05aaf-cdbcf394">Park Slope Brooklyn to Glassboro NJ</a>. I had some fun. I met a bunch of freshmen. They all... had no idea what was going on. Some were scared, others were confused, others were so hurt and all they could do is play the harmonica.

"Simple truth number sixty two, you help someone, you help yourself."

Now for the rest of this post I'm going to pull from unposted posts.

a lot of abstract considering the beginning of this post was unfinished too

<b>New Photo Section "Friends"</b>
Just check out the side bar.

<b>The Good Girl</b>
Is a really good movie and deserves its own post but at this point its not getting one.

<b>The Buterfly Effect, Directors Cut</b>
Is a <b>lot</b> better then the theatrical version. I own it now, but back when I was going to post about it I wanted to buy it... Just rent it, you'll either love it or hate it I guess. And please get past the lead character's actor, to hate it just because he's good at playing a dumb ass makes you the same, he can act.

<b>Wizard Computing</b>
<a href="http://www.wizardcomputing.com">Wizardcomputing</a> is my ever fledging business. I'm good at what I do, I just need to sleep at night. Jason helped me on my website.

<b>Clayton Sucks</b>
Concert,
BATMAN, ECTO - 1
TICKET
19 pound turkey
Scarface
Flat tire

I think that boils down to... I went to go see The White Stripes and on my way out I saw a car with the license plate "BATMAN" and another with "ECTO-1" and I found it quite amusing. I also got a free 19 pound turkey from shopright (this was around thanksgiving) because of the price plus car I own. Later I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/">Scarface</a> with Steff and had a really good time, one of the last that I can recall =/ and while we were out getting sushi I got my first flat tire, lost my tire key (and found it) and changed my tire in the poring rain (only for you dear), It was quite an experience. Pity I didn't write about it at the time.

<b>Andrew and a balloon</b>
"For Store hours and locations press 1, For Reservations and birthday parties press 63"

I'm very happy to say that my good friend andrew has graduated highschool. He was a little late in getting it done but at no fault to his intelligence, just his dilligence.
Lazertag! Lazer Park is a video game arcade and lazer tag arena (largest indoor arena on the east coast).

(This post was from august 2003 - and we released a balloon with my email on it but nobody ever found it.)

<b>I'm only happy when it rains.</b>
Michelle
Rain
Photo's

I have no idea... I really like that song, Michelle is a good friend I know... and I like the rain and photos. This post was from 2003-08-07 and it was really much too long ago.. over a year.

And thats everything I've been harboring for over a year, it probably makes as much sense to you as it does me. It's been too long.

Lately I've had a lot of different things going on I guess, less amazing thing, and a lot more work mixed in with a little of not sleeping for 2 days. But I continue to work, one of these days I'll get back to my friends on weekends, or days when they have no school.

Maybe one day I'll gear all my jobs so I can work on them from any computer anywhere and I'll go on a trip. Tour Europe (visit Ellie =) ) go around Italy (visit my family), and then come back to America except tour the west coast, I'm bound to have family out there too (well I know I do in Washington), Maybe Japan while I'm at it, why not?
