I have lots of new photos from this weekend. From my <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=Grandparents">Grandparents visit</a> to my night wandering the city. I also have pictures from my trip to the <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=Cherryhillvolvo">Cherry Hill Volvo Service Station</a> and  <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=rowanfoodcourtlounge">just hanging around campus.</a>

My favorite series I call <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=snowbrooklyn&page=1">Snow Brooklyn</a> that I took right after it snowed on sunday.

I want to show everybody my night hangout <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=homeLiberty">Liberty Diner</a> its a heck of a place - I love it.

I also created a new <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=peoplefranciswebcam">fake webcam</a> that you can see on the right there. (Quite Noticeable)

Lastly the <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=Night-out-12-16-2003">biggest shoot of the weekend</a> was hanging out with my friends in manhattan where we saw <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/big_fish/">Big Fish the movie</a> it was quite good. But I hear it was a pretty good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1565122178/ref%3Dpd%5Fsl%5Faw%5Falx-jeb-7-1%5Fbook%5F2584579%5F1/104-2464447-1795956">book</a> too.

It was a good weekend. Enjoy the photos and feel free to leave comments on them (you can you know). Ohh and just because people don't always realize if the photo has a frame around it (like a Polaroid sorta) its an album and you can click on it to see the photos its contains.

Ohh and a few of those photos were taken by other people they'll get credit soon enough. (The "owner" of each photo.) They just need to get around to it.
