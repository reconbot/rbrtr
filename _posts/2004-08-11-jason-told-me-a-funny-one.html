So a patrol in Iraq finds a Marine and a Iraqi Soldier bloody and beaten on either side of a road. They provide both with immediate medical attention and try and raise the marine. He finally awakes and they asked him what happened.

"Well I was walking down the road when I came upon the Iraqi. So I yelled 'Saddam is a mother fucker!' and he yelled 'Bush is mother fucker!'. The truck hit us when we were shaking hands."

=D

Thank you Jason and About.com for that one.
