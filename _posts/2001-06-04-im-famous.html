I was wandering around the net and found some pictures from the Trinity Robotics competition. One of these pictures Includes me writing something down when I was talking with Scott Savage. (nice guy, he invented the very handy <a href="http://www.oopic.com">OOpic</a> controller) Its the first picture on the "Contest Day" picturs page at trinity. (<a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/envir01.htm">here</a>) Well I think I've given our content editor enough text to check over for now. (I better quit before he starts complaining. =b ) <br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
