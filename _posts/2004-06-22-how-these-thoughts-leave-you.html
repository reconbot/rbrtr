I had things to say... What were they? Where do my thoughts go?

I found my self on a beach and I talked my self into being inspired about my work at the school. Made me want to teach.

I made my self some toasted american cheese on rye bread with warm tomato soup. Made me happy.

I found a friend and we shared a hug. Let me relax.

I heard a song about things being alright. I bought the album and it was even better.

I was made a cup of chamomile tea with honey and a bit of lemon. It calmed my nerves, and my stomach.

I finished some of my work and got payed. I can now buy food, pay back my friends and save the rest. And get some rest.
