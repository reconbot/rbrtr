Ever see anyone fold a paper airplane really fast infront of you? Well now you can have a flash app do it. I haven't tried any of the folds yet but they look really cool.

I should probably tell you all about a neat little firefox extention I found called Stumble!. (It's where all these links are comming from.) But I won't. Now now anyway.
