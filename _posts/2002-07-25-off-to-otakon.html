I'm going to Baltimore to attend <a href="http://www.otakon.com">Otakon</a>. Should be fun. I'll have plenty of pics, but unfortunately my camera's charger broke. =( Fortunately I know how to fix such things and I built myself a new one. =) (I'm going to call Nikon as soon as I get back. I prefer using their charger to using my ghetto-charger.)
