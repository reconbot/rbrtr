No actually, really free. Honest to god.

Cd's used, mine no less. Actual original CDs, I do buy music sometimes, you know.

All free, first come first serve. I may give priority to anyone who helps me move.

PS If I don't know you, you can't help me move, unless I'm convinced you are exceptionally cool.
