I some how came across an old comic called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_tract">Chick Tract</a> which is a comic by this intolerant artist Jack Chick. He's a Christian fundamentalist and his comics usually condemns other religions, even catholics. Here's the "tract" that caught my eye.

"A physician appears and notifies Suzi that she has contracted a STD. The particular STD depends on the version ‚Äì in the 1980 version, it is herpes, while in the 1992 version, it is gonorrhoea. In the 1992 version, he then informs the victim that she also has AIDS and notes that condoms are porous and do not provide adequate protection against the virus that causes AIDS."
