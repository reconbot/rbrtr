And <a href="http://gadling.blogspot.com/2005/07/after-getting-pissed-off-with-what.html">this</a> is apparently how you make it. Read the comments that go along with the instructions (forget the comments on the blog post), people get so passionate over their tea.

PS I like my milk with tea personally, Earl Gray or some sort of English Breakfast... but probably not the stuff you'd get here, it was just black tea from a tin, pitty I can't remember it's name. Over in england they drink it like coffee.

PSS I can't believe I still haven't finished posting <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/londonbritishmuseum">these pictures</a>. I don't think I even got to half of them. This set is the british Museum.
