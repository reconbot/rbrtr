Its amazing how fast things can add up. It takes so long to make them managable again.<p>

Sunday Bloody Sunday</b>
<p>
Yes...<br>
</p>
<p>
I can't believe the news today<br>
Oh, I can't close my eyes <br>
And make it go away<br>
How long...<br>
How long must we sing this song?<br>
How long?  How long...<br>
'cause tonight...we can be as one<br>
Tonight...<br>
</p>
<p>
Broken bottles under children's feet<br>
Bodies strewn across the dead end street<br>
But I won't heed the battle call<br>
It puts my back up<br>
Puts my back up against the wall<br>
</p>
<p>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
</p>
<p>
And the battle's just begun<br>
There's many lost, but tell me who has won<br>
The trench is dug within our hearts<br>
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters <br>
Torn apart<br>
</p>
<p>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
</p>
<p>
How long...<br>
How long must we sing this song?<br>
How long?  How long...<br>
'cause tonight...we can be as one<br>
Tonight...tonight... <br>
</p>
<p>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday<br>
</p>
<p>
Wipe the tears from your eyes<br>
Wipe your tears away<br>
Oh, wipe your tears away<br>
Oh, wipe your tears away<br>
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)<br>
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes<br>
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)<br>
</p>
<p>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)<br>
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)<br>
</p>
<p>
And it's true we are immune<br>
When fact is fiction and TV reality<br>
And today the millions cry<br>
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die<br>
</p>
<p>
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)<br>
</p>
<p>
The real battle just begun<br>
To claim the victory Jesus won<br>
On...<br>
</p>
<p>
Sunday Bloody Sunday<br>
Sunday Bloody Sunday...<br>
