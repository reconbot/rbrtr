This is probably going to be another boring post.

For some people.

During a recent trip to Richland WA, I had a small discussion with my grandfather about power generation. He's a scientist. I don't know most of his specifics off hand but I know he's mostly worked for the government (in one way or another), has worked on heat shielding that nasa currently uses, went to the artic on an expedition for some research, and has done a lot of nuclear research and testing. For power not bombs. I'm realizing the extent of what I can tell about my grandfathers history and achievements off the top of my head is quite lacking. I think I need some more visits.

He stated to me in no uncertain terms that coal power generation is putting more radiation in our atmosphere then every nuclear accident ever. This made me curious. So I decided to look it up.
