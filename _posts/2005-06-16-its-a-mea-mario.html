My good friend Mario! Is at it again! This time he's bringing his own Pizza Pie!

And by Pizza Pie I mean <a href="http://www.pressthebuttons.com/2005/06/do_the_mario_on.html">DVD set of his Super Mario Bros. Super Show</a>! That young lad Link get's his friday Zelda special on DVD too!

You can find out more about the shows from <a href="http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/544.html">X-Entertainment</a>

I also tracked the source of this story back through about 5 or 6 blogs and small time news sites. This all started because DVD planet started pre-selling them.
<a href="http://www.dvdplanet.com/product_listing.asp?productid=58928&format=DVD">Super Mario Brothers Super Show</a>
<a href="http://www.dvdplanet.com/product_listing.asp?productid=58925&format=DVD">Legend Of Zelda: Complete Series</a>
They're about $20 each, coming out in october it looks like. But the Mario one is listed as "Discontinued" while the Zelda is marked as "Coming soon"

Amazon had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005UO76/ref=ase_wizardcomputi-20/103-9561737-8732660?v=glance&s=dvd">Best of Super Mario Bros. DVD</a> but no mention of the of the other two. All that being said, I'm sure come october you'll be able to find them at any DVD store. Netflix too.

I'm hungry, I think I'm going to go have some pasta and tomato sause. Maybe some garlic. Oh, and did I tell anyone about my new faveriote linux distobution <a href="http://www.whoppix.net/">Whoppix?</a> Forget about it, I'll do it another time.
