(I'm not going to review these movies. If you really want to know what they're about click the links and read the reviews. In fact do that now so you have some idea what I'm talking about.)

<a href="http://aznfilms.com/product_info.php/products_id/1000">Suicide Club</a> is a stupid movie. I can honestly say it prevoked some reaction out of me. I ooooed and ahhhed when appropriate but I spent most of the time going "What the fuck?" and "Why'd she do that?". The story.. is stupid and the director/screen writer forgot to finish the movie. He also forgot to remove a few failed story-lines that made no sense. The big thing is now that I can say I've seen it. Ohh and watch out for the opening scene where 50 asian schoolgirls happily throw them selves in front of a train. (I couldn't even find this movie on IMDB)

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280760/">Igby Goes Down</a> is not a stupid movie. Unless you really really hate Catcher in the Rye. Its not the story of Holden Caufield its the story of Igby (his real name in the movie escapes me.) Igby is a very smart jaded 16 year old kid kicking around new york with no real purpose. Now don't get me wrong Catcher in the Rye was not a life changing book in my opinion, it was a book about a depressed kid who made things up. But I still found it interesting. Igby (played by Kieran Culkin - who is a good actor) is quite likable and you end up caring what happens to him. If you're still looking for a reason to see this movie maybe Claire Danes, Jeff Goldblum, Susan Sarandon, and Bill Pullman are good enough reasons. Apparently they all liked the script so much they volunteered to be part of it (with modest pay of course).

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115736/">Bound</a> (One of many movies with that title apparently.) is the Wachowski Brother's first movie. You can see where the matrix comes from. Everybody is wearing cool looking outfits (usually leather) and everything is dark with a looming sensation. I kept cracking jokes about how things were "inevitable" and how things were people's "destiny" I don't think Sarah found them too funny though. <b>WARNING</b> This movie contains lesbians and the Mafia.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264761/">Kissing Jessica Stein</a> is a funny romantic comedy about two of my best friends. Honesty it was a little scary watching it. Its a good movies overall and I liked it a lot, it was just ire that I knew the two main characters already. Ohh... <b>WARNING</b> This movie contains lesbians, New York City and Scarsdale New York.

In light of an ever growing "Hey I want to see that movie." list I decided to try a free two week trial of <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>. I've got 39 movies in my queue and 3 on their way to me. I'm going to be seeing every movie I've ever dreamt of seeing plus all the movies everyone has ever recommended to me. =D
