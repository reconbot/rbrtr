I had an idea for a book, a wiki sorta. A place where people can share experiences or maybe I can just use it to edit what I write. So I setup a <a href="http://wiki.roborooter.com">Roborooter Wiki</a> to play with in the mean time. I need to write more to start it off so people have something to work off of but its a start.

Also I found a <a href="/ftp/feuerfreimovie.swf">movie</a> that people might like. (Apparently its making its rounds.)
