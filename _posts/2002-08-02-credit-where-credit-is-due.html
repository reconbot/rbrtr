The pictures scripts on this site are not mine though I've called them mine quite a lot. I use them legally and with premission, but the scripts creator is not me, it's Mike. He's still on the staff page here at Roborooter.com. Credit for the engine behind this entire site goes to him actually. Its been changed a little but only for asthetics. And credit for that (and the design, graphics, colors, everything for roborooter.com) goes to Emily (who is also on out staff page). Without her we'd be damn ugly.<p>So from now on if I write "my pictures script" I'll be wrong and you'll know it.
