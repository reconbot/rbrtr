Today roborooter is going live. Its not currently live (because it still looks like crap and has links to people I don't know) but later today when things improve you'll be able to see it in all its failing glory. The reason for the update (not because it needs it) is because I'm finaly geting somebody that knows what they're doing when it comes to html to help out. (I used to know how...) Well I'm hoping it comes out good and it should judging from her other works.
