I just spent 18 hours finishing my world regional geography report. Its now 6:50am. I've got 2 thing to say.<p>
1) You can view the decrepit Microsoft word web page version <a
href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/wrg/wrg.htm">here</a> but I highly recommend you go and use Microsoft word
and download the actual report <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/wrg/wrg.doc">here</a>. This is only if you
want to know everything about Poland or like reading my reports so you can find my mistakes and make fun of
me.<p>
2) Professor Hasse your a nice guy but fuck you. I never want to take your class again. <br>(Fuck me too - I'm the
dumb-ass who didn't do his work earlier - I'm fare we both get insulted. But seriously you don't want to know
that much about Poland. Its a cool country but see a movie about it or something don't read my report. Just give
it a b+ and move on with it. We both have things to do.)<p>
God dammit I'm too tired to even make a  witty post. (shut up - don't say it - its not even funny)
