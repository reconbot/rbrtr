So I was almost asleep having convinced myself that ... heh, I don't even remember anymore. Anyway, I was sleeping almost and then "ZZZZZZeeeeeppp" the doppler of a bug flying around my ear. I don't even know if I killed it. Fucking bugs.

Anyway, I finally found this song that's been running through my head.

<b>You Showed Me</a>
<em>The Turtles</em>

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
Oh, oh, I love   you

You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
You fell for me too

And when I tried   it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all

You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
We're in love we too

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're in love we two
We two

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
(You...)

Showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
(You...)

Taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Now you love me too
