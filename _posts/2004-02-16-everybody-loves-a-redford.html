Tonight I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a> it was shown to me as a kid by my mother (a woman ahead of her time in knowing what was ahead of her time) who found it to be quite fun. I can look back (all the way to 1992 when I was 8) and recognize the technologies they used in the movie in real life. Makes me wish I was born in the late 70's so I could a punk teen when all this was going on.

Also to note that I Finished Big O season 1 (think Japanese Batman with cooler toys and not so many men in tights) and it was good, along with 3 Kings which is a movie I appreciate more every time I watch it.
