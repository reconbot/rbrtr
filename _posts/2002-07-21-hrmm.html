Someone told me recently that I should write down all my rants and raves about life and things I've figured out. (I normally just go and tell a whole bunch of people until I lose interest.) I just might.<br> Also I got a digital camera of my own so I'm going to be putting up some more pictures... and probably changing the gallery script around too.
