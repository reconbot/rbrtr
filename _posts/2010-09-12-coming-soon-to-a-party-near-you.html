I got one of them <a href="http://www.gfxhax.com/drinkshield/">Drink Shields</a> and assembled it today. It uses a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8880">Alcohol Gas Sensor MQ-3</a> to take readings and displays them on a light bar that goes up to 11. No idea how to convert this to BAC but one beer didn't even push one led a few minutes after drinking. The datasheet says it needs a 20 hour burn in before the sensor becomes reliable so we'll have to see.
