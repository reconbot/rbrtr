I'm told panic attacks are all in your mind. You can either fear the attack and have one, or you can have something trigger it. I get triggered panic attacks, my breath will shorten, my heart rate will increase, and I'll get palpitations like crazy. I can calm down but my heart will still steadily beat away like its got something to prove palpating the entire time.

I also can't sleep when I get worked up.

Today I finished a total of 11 hours of homework spanning over two days. I'd drive to star bucks, buy an iced chai, and sit at a bar stool and do my work. The .5 MG of Clonazepam helped too. I was prescribed Clonazepam a while back to help me sleep (to replace the Ambian I sometimes take). I thought it was a sleep aid and it's not. So I figured it didn't work. Apparently it was developed for people who have seizures, it calms the brain to put it simply. The prescribing doctor figured I'd calm down and fall asleep, I figured It would help me goto sleep so I didn't think it worked. I've read up on it since then.

So I'm done with all my Symbolic logic homework - ever. I did it all from the first assignment to the last. Tomorrow I start Calculous. Then I make sure I'm caught up with Lab Techniques, and I work on my Java Project. (I need to learn file IO.)

I should be completely wrapped up with finals and projects by Wednesday May 5th. I start my summer session up June 1st. With a brief overlap in summer sessions I have Physics and then College Composition until August 12th.

From August 12th until around August 31st I plan on visiting Europe.

Anyway - my hearts slowed. I'm keeping things out of mind and I'm going to try to fall asleep again.
