Frank bought me <a href="http://www.treelinefilms.com/product/video/horror_classics_meg_desc.shtml">this</a> the other day.

I'm not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing, I love horror films yet there's 50. I can see my self wasting a lot of free time on this.

The back of the box lists all 50, I'm going to have to check them off as I watch them and X them out as they suck too much to finish. Now I'm sure I'm going to love <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/">Metropolis</a> and I'm sure I'm going like seeing the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/">Night of the Living Dead</a> (By the way I recently saw the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/">remake</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077402/">Dawn of the Dead</a> and I have to say I enjoyed it throughly.) but I can't believe that all 50 of these movies are going to be watchable.

I can't even find some of them on <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>. "the Terror Doomed to Die" is one of them. I did find a page for "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052846/">The Giant Gila Monster</a>" but I'm not sure thats going to make the film any better then any of the others.

This should be fun, cheep 1930's horror fun but fun all the same. I can only hope that the lack of special effects makes for a better story. ;-)
