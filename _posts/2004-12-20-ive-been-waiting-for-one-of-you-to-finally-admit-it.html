<a href="http://www.somethingpositive.net/sp12142004.shtml">Something Positive</a> hit something that's been bothering me right on the nose today. (Well the other day really.)

It's kinda scary to see how common your own problems can be or have been. Everyone likes to think that they're unique but we all know that's a fallacy. I have it on good authority that people have been around for a while and they've been interacting, thinking and acting a while longer.

I wonder if every thought has been thought, every scene acted, every fight fought, every faced kissed.

Bah, I'm just dimestoring. It's been so long since I've spouted philosophy its all I can afford.
