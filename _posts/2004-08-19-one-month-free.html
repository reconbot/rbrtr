I apparently for a limited time can get people a <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> subscription for one month free. If you notice I'm a happy user of Netflix (you can check out my current rentals on the right side over there --->) and I'd recommend it to anyone who spends more then 20 bucks a month renting movies. No late fees, etc. I'm not an advertisement you can look at their site if you want it. But the first 5 (I don't know if I'll be able to send more "invitations" and no they won't spam you.) people to get me their email addresses I'll send the "invitation" that entitles you to one free month.
