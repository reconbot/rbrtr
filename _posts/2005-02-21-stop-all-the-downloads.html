I did a 180 in the space of one and a half lanes. I love driving in light snow. Not hellish deep snow I vowed never to drive again with (at all ever noun noun verb noun).

By the way a 180 being a U-Turn.

I had my 21st birthday the other night and people are still staying over at my house to go home monday morning. This has been a really good birthday, complete with a Chinese dinner I don't remember, pool, Jazz, ping pong, a wonderful italian dinner, a brand new camera, wonderful friends and wonderful family.

Jenny took photos. Once she posts them I'll make comments and stuff.

Good Night all.
