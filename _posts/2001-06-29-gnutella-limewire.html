Koudelka kindly wrote a script for us that will correct any files that are "touched by windows". Oh and not this this is the forum for this kind of stuff but get "Limewire" its realy much better then napster in all regard.<p style="text-indent: 30pt">Oh and if our content director could start with adding real stuff to the staff page, that would be cool. I'll get the photos I have in the appropieate directory sometime tomorow, but I've been pretty bussy packing latly so I havent gotten around to it. (not that this is excusing the weeks before when I could have done it) Umm... Have a happy day. =)
