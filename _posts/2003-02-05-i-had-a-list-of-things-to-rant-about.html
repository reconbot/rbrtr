Would you believe its already February? Wow only 14 more days before I'm the oldest possible teenager. (*note - rant about getting older removed.)
<p>I know this is a shameless plug but I'll get it over with. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/20RQTOEOU9RE2">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/gimme.cgi?wid=81cdb8abd">Here</a> and <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl?biter=Billwontstop">here</a> (the last has absolutely nothing to do with the first two - I don't actually want anything from this site.)
<p>On a much cooler note the first episode of the <a href="http://progressive.stream.aol.com/wb/gl/wbonline/progressive/thematrix/us/med/animatrixlgfinal_dl.mov">Animatrix</a> has been released.
<p>(I'm not feeling the talkative vibe today. Maybe later.) Finally I urge you to start reading <a
href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/strips/sw01.shtml">Diesel Sweeties</a> and to start from the beginning. The current comics don't make any sense with out the begining... well they'll make more sense anyhow.
