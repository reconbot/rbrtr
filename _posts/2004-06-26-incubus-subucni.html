So I went to Madison Square Garden tonight with Cassie, Caroline, Jenny, some guy I don't know, Meggan, and some boyfriend of hers. Cindy, Becky, Julia, A girl I never got her name right, and a monkey had different seats but were there too.

I had a real good time. I can't stress this enough.

I lost my voice with in the first 5 minutes.

Found some meaning to old songs.

Danced my ass off, sweated tones. I never dried from the rain that got me drenched earlier in the day.

Drove someone Cindy's car home =)

Downloaded some more music to listen tomorrow.

Oh! and the Drums! I could barley keep up with them. I wore my self out pretty fast but I kept dancing anyway. I've never heard them play them before. They're really good.

Ohhh that sound =)

I earned my sleep tonight.
