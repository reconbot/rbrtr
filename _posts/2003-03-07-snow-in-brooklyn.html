I may get a new laptop from apple to replace my old broken one. Well I am its just that they can't seem to get where I live strait. I hopefully will be getting it monday - but as far as I can tell its getting sent to the "Park Slope Copy Center" (firmly located in brooklyn) in Glassburo NJ. I await the email back from apple. I hope fedex can find me in the meen time.
