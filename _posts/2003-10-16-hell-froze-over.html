I'm serious it froze over. <a href="http://www.apple.com">Check it out.</a> (Note: If your reading this a few days from now just go <a href="http://www.itunes.com">here</a> instead.)

I used to be a winamp kid. Winamp is nice, small, does what it's supposed to do. But iTunes is like a brand new car. Sure it drives just like your <a href="http://www.epinions.com/auto_Make-1994_Volvo_940">1994 Volvo</a> did but it does it better and oh so much more. Seriously get it now, try it out.
