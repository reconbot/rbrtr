Today I am a proud owner of a Blockbuster Video card. I rented <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120601">Being
John Malkovich</a> a film by Charlie Kaufman. And Princess Mononoke or <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119698">"Mononoke Hime"</a> as it's originally called. I've seen both movies and
they are both very good in their own rights. They don't necessarily go to gether but that didn't stop me from
renting them. On a side note my good friend Sarah made a new webcam for me. I probably need to go take a few
more pics.
