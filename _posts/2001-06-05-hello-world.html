This is my first update, so I suppose I should introduce myself. I am the designer for roborooter and I've put up a test page with the <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/cloud/test.html">design</a> I'm currently working on, which may become the new design. Be sure to take a look at the new black version of the design too.

<em>(Update on March 29, 2002: Things sure have changed... it's almost difficult to believe how much. Anyway, I'm glad that I didn't say "Please allow me to introduce myself..." way back when; I am neither the devil nor Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigailov. I think I'll just leave this here the way it is, pristine and untouched.)</em>
