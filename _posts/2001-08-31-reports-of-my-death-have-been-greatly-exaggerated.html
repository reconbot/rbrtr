Ok, I figured that there was no point in posting until I had something to post. "Does this
post mean you changed your mind, then", you ask? No you fool! It means... that I have something
to post! That friend of a friend who has that comics site at <a href="http://www.imaginationcomics.com">
Imagination Comics</a> has finally returned from the great white north and is living about five
blocks from me. This means that I will soon begin working on migrating his site off geoshi-i mean
geocities and onto our spacious but lonely servers. I haven't talked to Francis in about 3 weeks,
so I have no idea what this Petra (Dawn-Ann) business is, but you can rest assured that I won't
lose any sleep over it. Having put your minds, however pathetic, at ease, I shall leave you once
more.<br> Wireheadedly yours,<br>-<a href="mailto:rooney@roborooter.com">Rooney</a>
