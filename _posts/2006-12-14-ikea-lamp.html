One of my favorite directors (and I don't really care about directors) is Spike Jonze. He's mostly done music videos and commercials. I just found out that he did an Ikea ad that I found quite funny. So in honor of that...

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/movies/IkeaLampcommercial.avi">Ikea Lamp Ad</a>

<b>UPDATE</b>
I was told that link doesn't work (stupid quicktime) it should work now (stupid avi).
And while.. I have problems doing this I can recognize that this will be the easiest way to watch the movie for most people...
