My good friend <a href="http://sarah.roborooter.com">Sarah</a>  got a new camera the other day. It's <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/newcamera">really neat</a>. It's tiny, fast, has loads of features and kicks the crap out of my camera by far.

I'd really like to get a new one eventually but my good ole' Nikon still has some life in it. So all the photos I take this winter in England will be with it.

More importantly she took pictures of me. <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/littlechinawithfrancis">Hanging out in little china</a> and <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/libertymattmattfrancis">the three of us (Matt, Sarah and myself) at liberty diner</a>.
