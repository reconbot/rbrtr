I was too blown away by my second final last night to post. It wasn't *that* hard, it was just a mind fuck. Thank you Dr. Provine! I'll recommend this professor to anyone who wants to learn and can take a little bit of pressure. He's certainly not the type to do all the teaching him self.

"What's blah and blah?"
"I don't know." (lie) "What do <em>you</em> think blah and blah is?"

I'm off to my calc final, I suck so much at this, I feel like I've been taking calculous for ever, like its a bully that keeps kicking my ass and taking my lunch money. Its not even that hard. I better not keep any money on me just in case though.
