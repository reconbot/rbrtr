I'm an idiot but I think I'm going to make some changes to roborooter. Update it a bit. Not news wise but backend wise. I want to put the photos back, (and add some more) have comments on news (I don't know if I want this or not =p) and who knows what else? Just some stuff.<p>
<b>Updates</b>: I suprised the hell out of my self but I am awake! In the morning!
Today I plan on: Getting Andrew's Birthday thing planned,
Working on Opinion Online, Doing that thing to bthsnews,
Finding out the deal with Leon and Bthsnews,
Work! I got to get stuff done there.
Ohh yea and my mother wants me to help her buy a mattress today. And I might buy an airconditioner for my dad. He wanted me to get one for him.
