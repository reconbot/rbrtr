I just registered for the three day computer security.. well Hacker Conference "HOPE: Hackers of planet Earth". So far they have a few keynote speakers listed including Adam Savage and of course Kevin Mitnick.  Adam Savage is well known as a Mythbuster, maker, and lover of wonderful things. I even saw him at last years <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/v/Events/mermaidparade/">Mermaid Parade</a>.  I've emailed him to find out what he's doing at The Last Hope, because while I'm sure he'll find it cool, I don't know why he'd be a keynote speaker.

Also presenting is a very interesting guy named Barry Wels who when not professionally testing locks for security flaws, (I'd be lying if I said it was about the money for this guy) writes for his blog <a href="http://www.toool.nl/blackbag">Black Bag</a> and runs a group called Toool. The saying goes that to get good at lock picking you have to practice over and over and over again. The 3rd O is for that extra "over". Even more noteworthy, he got his government to hold off on electronic voting because of how <a href="http://www.toool.nl/blackbag/?p=129">obviously easy </a> the machines were to hack.  The mayor of Anderdam took notice of his groups efforts and made it illegal to use the flawed machines. Bary is another person I widely admire.

Hope isn't as large as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON">Def Con</a> the Las Vegas based annual convention. But I couldn't afford to goto that anyway. 

So I've got 3 days for my $75 and I'm sure I'll enjoy the crap out of it. I probably wont spend all three days there, but until they release a schedule I'll have to just assume everything will be interesting and plan for that. I'm going to bring a mostly empty laptop and my camera, and maybe a bag of tricks. 

While I'm sure I'll meet people there, is anyone interested in going with me? We've got a home field advantage, most of the people there are staying 7 to a room at the cheapest hotel they can find. We'll be well rested, well fed and not scared of New York.

At least not anymore then we should be.

<strong>Update!</strong>
Adam Savage wrote back to me. He'll be speaking about 

<blockquote>Obsession.  The nature of.  Subset mine.</blockquote>

Go figure.
