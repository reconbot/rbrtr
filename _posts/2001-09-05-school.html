I'm in school right now. Apparently our teacher for Cisco has decided to pretend he doesn't like us and says "I can't handle this kind of respect from you people. I'm going to change the program and get you a different teacher!" Well a few of us are calling his bluff. We heard from a former teacher (Mr. Yanakis) that we weren't going to keep this guy (Mr. Rodriguez) as our teacher anyway. His response was "Mr. Yanakis knew you were going to be bad?"<br>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
