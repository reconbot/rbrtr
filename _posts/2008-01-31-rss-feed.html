Since last mucking around with my site's templates I've started to use RSS pretty religiously. If you've subscribed to my site's feed you probably got the old ".rdf" RSS 1.0 feed as it was the only advertised up top.
<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/index.xml"><img alt="clickmeforRSS.png" src="http://www.roborooter.com/images/clickmeforRSS.png" width="295" height="74" /></a>
I've changed it to default to the new ".xml" RSS 2.0 feed and I've also made sure both feeds have my full post content in them. Nothing pisses me off more then a teaser feed. I have to warn you though, I like doing fancy things in my post and they might not all show up in your <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">reader of choice</a> so if something doesn't look right, feel free to visit my actual site. But seeing that I don't run ads to support me, nor do I have that much special extra stuff to offer I wont make you come here to read what I have to say. The fact you're reading it nice enough. =)

<b>Update:</b> I don't know how rss readers deal with updates though.. I do that a lot, I make a lot of adjustments after I publish.
