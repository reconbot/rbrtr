Its been quite a week, I'm kind of shocked its almost over. For almost a month I've been taking a drug called Effexor XR on the advice of my school's psychiatrists. I can't say I've liked the effects of it. I've been quite out of it this week. I can't completely blame the drug though, this past weekend was pretty hard on the emotions too. And as a friend pointed out today that I start acting odd even before I take the drug (though I didn't notice) so some of it may be in my head. Who knows? Either way I'm weaning my self off it.

Today I broke the back-end of the site, blamed the server's maintainers promptly apologized and then fixed the problem. No one was the wiser.

I also did something that people have been bugging me to do for a long time. I'll keep you in the dark until I have everything setup the way I like it.

P.S. <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=Spangle28">Someone</a> told me to read this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson. I guess you had to be there, but Emerson is good on his own anyway.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Though slowly and with pain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of thought do. There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons. But in health theâ€ mind is presently seen again- its overarching vault, bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears, that swept over us as clouds, must lose their finite character and blend with God, to attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we can lose any thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to the end. That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations, must be succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on for ever."
