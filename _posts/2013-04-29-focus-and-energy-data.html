For some reason tonight all I want to do is figure out how to answer the question "Where is my power coming from?" from the following <a href="http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/load_data/index.jsp" target="_blank">nyiso market data</a>. It does not seem possible, which irks me to no end as their pretty transparent about most of the power generation operations of New York State.

If you know anything about solving this problem. Even solving it for different countries or states! Please let me know, we should chat.

You can track my progress trying to solve this issue at my <a href="https://github.com/reconbot/nyiso-data" target="_blank">nyiso-data github project</a>.
