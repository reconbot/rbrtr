<a href="http://roborooter.com/ftp/rowan_rainbow.mov">This</a> 3.5 meg movie of a rainbow was taken on my nikon
coolpix 995 digital camera. The origional was 11mb! The poeple you see in the movie are some of my friends. From
left to right you'll see Sarah, James, and Michelle.
Sarah is an undeclared major but is moving towards "psych, sociology, art, or eduction". James is another ECE
like myself (electrical and computer
engineering). And Michelle is a Vocal Education major. <p> The rainbow appeared during a break in our
heavy rain that we got last week. It only lasted about 20 minutes but it was quite beautiful.
