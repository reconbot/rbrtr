So you know those <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/ftp/endofworld.swf">end of the world</a> guys? Well they're a <a href="http://www.nike.com/usa/nikesphere/index.jhtml">lot richer now</a>. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.machall.com">MacHall</a> for pointing that out.)

The only think I don't get about that shirt is why when your hot you don't want sweat. I always thought it's evaporating kept you cool, maybe this wisking away property of the shirt has the same effect. *shrug*

In other news, The <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/10/20/nyc_high_schoolers_surveyed_on_sex_drug_and_booze.php">New York Times</a> says Brooklyn students are loose, while Manhattan kids want to die (of jealousy of course), and Staten Island kids do a lot of drugs (what else is there in Richmond county?). I'm not surprised about that drug problem.
