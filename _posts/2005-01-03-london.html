(I don't have my usual spelling and gammer tools on hand so what your getting is %100 pure francis style engish. I'm not even trying hard. I'll fix it up later.)

So I've been wandering around London lately. It's nice. Old. I mean there's history eveywhere. You can't go to the corner store with out some deep history around it. (in the heart of london anyway, I'm staying out in Harrow, on the hill. Everything is old, around 200 years or so but not the corner stores.) I have tons of photos to show you too. I can't upload them here, way to slow, and Sarah's been uploading photo's so I'm almost out of disk space to boot. I'll have more soon (Sarah please don't feel bad the disk space is there to be used, if it sat around empty for the rest of it's life it would be quite wasted.) and when I either get to a Starbucks (they have plenty of them here) and find my account working overseas or home (a little over a week from now) you'll all get to see them.

There are still a few places I'd like to go and take pictures of anyway. Never mind I have to process the ones I have. If you look at my Canada trip you'll find at least 200 or so, I've got easily twice that so far. So I need to remove the blurry ones (an afliction most of my photography has due to my camera's small apature and my less then steady hand) crop the odd ones and try to make sure I don't have too many random tourists looking into my camera when I didn't intend them to. Oh it will be intersting and lots of fun. I'm sure of it.

I'm in the middle of reading "empire star" by Samuel R. Delany and I'm writing like him. Though while a bit more scattered I'm a whole lot more intersting. Sam, as he doesn't know I call him, has a vivid imagination and likes to explain things and include details much like how I mentioned I call him Sam. I don't like his writing style too much.

I also recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345316509/102-6712267-5069728?v=glance">"Job: a comedy of Justice"</a> by Hienline. It's one of his "boyish" books. Kid gets put in a wonderfull exciting adventure against his will, kid turns out to be Hienline. I won't berate the author for that he's a pretty intersting character. Though when I did finish it I cursed him. He came up with such... amazing views on heaven and hell in this book that I wanted to slug him in the face. And to be honest I don't know why. Probably a learned reaction from all those years of church I've forgotten. It was a really good book though, his books often are. That is if you can get past him, some people get hung up on his love of throwing society in people's faces by exploiting taboos. (Well that's one way to say it.) Or his horrible/wonderfull views on sex, relationships, and the human condition. Hienline was a thinker I'll give him that.

Oh and I also read (You know it's funny my brother asked me if I read the other day and went as far as asking me what book it was.  I used to read a novel every 2-3 days and then my eyesight left me. But normally, lately, I haven't been making time to read. So I guess his question was sorta valid. Anyway, back to the point) - I read "Neuromancer " by William Gibson. Wow.

My best reviews are always my shortest.

Gibson is good, as good as Orison Scott Card, As good as Neil Stephenson, as good as Asimov. And in 1983 he wrote Neuromancer and showed a world of networks, nural interfaces, hackers, crime, commercialism, and... oh boy I dunno, computers. Honestly, everything I can totally see happening in real life. I felt this way whe I was reading "Enders Game" (Orison Scott Card) when his charecters weant out on the net and started major political contravercy in forums and news groups. These authors truely write our future. Our inventors need to get a bigger imagination, because they didn't come up with what they're building. Our engineers on the other hand, good job so far.

In other news Brian is home and soon will be returning to his primary residence (his apartment). I thought of him today and the song I've been wating for popped into my head finally. This one is for you Brian.

THE ZUTONS LYRICS

"Pressure Point"

I can't get this pressure point out of my head
I can't get this pressure point out of my head
I feel it in work, you know, I feel it in bed
I can't get this pressure point out of my head
I've paid all my bills and I've acted so well
Ain't been cheating, there's nothing to tell
So why all this pressure, I dont understand
I call on my neighbours, and lend them a hand

Doctor, oh doctor, I'm willing to learn
Well all of my bones, well they toss and they turn
Mother, oh mother, I'm begging you please
To rid me of madness and cure this disease

... (?) told you what I have become
With all of this pressure, my mind's on a run
... (?) changing, let's hope for the best
Maybe it's something to get off my chest

Doctor, oh doctor, I'm begging you please
To rid me of madness and cure this disease
Mother, oh mother, I'm willing to learn
Well all of my bones, well they toss and they turn

Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...

I can't get this pressure point out of my head
I can't get this pressure point out of my head
I feel it in work, you know, I feel it in bed
I can't get this pressure point out of my head

Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
Pressure pressure pressure pressure...
