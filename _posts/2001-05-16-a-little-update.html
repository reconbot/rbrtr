I decided that the main roborooter page was temporary and should go away. I've also discovered that while all my information is intact (thank god) the new drive still has some problems. So tonight I'm transfering all its information onto my main machine so I can reinitialize it tomorow. Every thing should be intact untill I start working on it, but then I'm sure nobody will notice anyhow... <br> -Francis
