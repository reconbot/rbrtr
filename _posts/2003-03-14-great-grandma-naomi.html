Today my Great Grandmother Died. She was 98 years old. Her birthday was the day before mine. We'd both send each other cards each year. She was a gypsy growing up my mother says. Used to dance. I never saw her dance but you could tell there was still a fire behind her eyes. An energy in her mind that existed regardless of the body. She was amazing. She will be missed.
