I've got a nice compact archive for the majority of my writings. Inspired by <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yeggie</a> mentioning he found posts of 16 year old him on usenet (his chat <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/podcast-25/">here</a>), I decided to look into <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&quot;francis+gulotta&quot;+reconbot+wizard_2&amp;as_eq=&amp;num=50&amp;lr=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;ft=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_rights=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;cr=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;safe=off">me</a>. I don't think there is a single other place I've written more then for here. There's a distinct possiblility of instant messaging being a larger repository of my thoughts and plans, but I'm goign to argue it's a different medium. Those messages (Adium's got 8448 transcripts going back to May 2004) are much much much less thought out. Espicially if we've been talking for hours.

So what's in my non roborooter history?
