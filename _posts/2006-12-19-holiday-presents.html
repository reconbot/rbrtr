<a href="http://www.wondermark.com/d/074.html">Comic reference</a>

I just got another "I don't know what to get you this year" comment. And I realized I totally botched the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/20RQTOEOU9RE2/ref=wl_web/">amazon wishlist</a> idea this year. I guess I can only say I don't mind getting presents late. =)
