These people rock. Ever since the beginning I've had problems with people accessing my site. That is now over. I'm on a 2 day visit back to NY but I leave again tomorrow. Thank god for the open source community. If it weren't for them I would have never figured out how to fix the stupid problem (MTU needs to = 1472 not 1500 and I still don't know why).<br> And props to Kevin.
