This is pretty crazy... Check out this email I just received:

<em>This is a car advert from somewhere. When they finished filming the ad the people who made it noticed something moving along the side of the car, like a ghostly white mist.

The ad was never put on TV because the unexplained ghostly phenomenon frightened the production team out of their wits.

Watch it and about halfway look and you will see the white mist crossing in front of the car then following it along the road... Spooky!</em>

Turn your sound on, then click <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/movies/Classic_Auto_1.mpeg">here</a> to watch the movie.
