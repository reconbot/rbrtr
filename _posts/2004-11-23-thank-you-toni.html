While a few of my friends have copies of Amelie and some don't even know where they came from they assure me it's not my copy. So I get a phone call this morning from my good friend Toni, She doesn't like the movie and she's giving it to me. =)

Frank has some good jazz playing and I'm playing along with the band in my head.
