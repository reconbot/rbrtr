A friend of mine got a tattoo. She didn't get a big one or a flashy one. It was small, on the inside of her ankle. A butterfly. She got it for her self - not to show off. "It's kinda selfish" she says. She got it to mark the closing one chapter of her life but she wanted to remember the journey so she got the tattoo to remind her. I admire that kind of thing.
