The vote for the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2248">FISA Amendments Act</a> was postponed until tomorrow. I don't know why.

Let me start with three things. The last one being something new and more important.
1) You know my position on <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/post/573/stop-the-spyingorg/">Telecommunication Immunity</a> that is only part of the bill. And frankly I think I missed the point. The FISA Amendments Act would not only grant immunity to the crimes committed but it would grant immunity to <strong>all</strong> crimes they might have committed without revealing them. We don't know what they did and if this bill is passed we will never know. There was an amendment to <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/06/bingaman-amendment">reveal that information</a>.
2) I'm not against FISA, and I think it might need amending. I'm also not against the intelligence community or the ability for them to do their jobs. I'm against judgment of our constitutional rights taken out of the courts and into intelligence offices.
3) I'm also against the provisions for the legislative branch to be able to have sole discretion to authorize and keep secret surveillance of us citizens. This includes <strong>congressmen </strong>and <strong>senators</strong>.

That last bit kills me. It throws off the balance of power, and makes one branch of government susceptible to another.

<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1295224?pg=embed&amp;sec=1295224">What Every American Needs to Know (and Do) About FISA Before Tuesday, July 8th</a> from <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/user587198?pg=embed&amp;sec=1295224">Tim Ferriss</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1295224">Vimeo</a>.

Please take a minute. 60 seconds. Go to the <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?alertId=389&amp;pg=makeACall" target="_blank">EFF website here</a> and put in your zipcode to find your Senatorâ€™s phone number. Its a simple script you can read, you don't have to be scared of it. They just need to know you are a constituent, and that you don't like a part of the FISA Amendments Act. (Or the whole thing!)

That's it. It matters today, we'll see what happens during the vote tomorrow. Do it. It's not worth sitting back on this one.
