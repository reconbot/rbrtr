So I've been talking about being a <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/000536.html">robot</a> for halloween. And I'm still with it.

I can go a generic robot, like from the video. I can even protest. But this morning I had a thought that I should go as one of the these 3 below.

Bender

The RED ROBOT or Clango

Now I like the RED ROBOT a lot, but Clango is adorable. But even better, Bender likes to drink a lot of beer and has this hatch thing going on.

It's a tough call.
