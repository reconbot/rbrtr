A little known blog has popped up run by the people in my apartment.

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/theapartment/">Apartment.roborooter.com/</a>

I would like to point out my post.
<a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/theapartment/archives/000207.html">Tomacco, You know the half tomato half tobacco plant from the Simpsons? Yea, its real now.</a>

Don't forget your bling bling.
<a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archive/002272.php">The Gothamist on Bling Bling</a>

And last but not least.
<a href="http://keaner.net/journal/03-10-08.html">One man's interesting presentation on his trip to New York</a>

I have to say not living in New York City has made it a lot more interesting.
