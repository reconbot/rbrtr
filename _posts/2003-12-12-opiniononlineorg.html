Frank finally updated his website. I promised him a link. (And since he helped me get started I owe him one anyway. Click on the link below or the permeant one on the right side.

<a href="http://www.opiniononline.org/">http://www.opiniononline.org/</a>

Ohh and if it disappears it means he hasn't updated. If he wants it back he has to update. :-p
