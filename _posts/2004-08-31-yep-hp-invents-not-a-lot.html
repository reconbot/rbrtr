Yes Folks they are just regular iPods. Brought to you by HP after 6 months of development. It comes with some unnecessary <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_08_22_archive.htm#109370108538661090">kludgy software</a> that gets windows media player to play the ipod having it use iTunes... Well at least they look cool and cost about the same.
