I finally got my power cord delivered for my laptop so I'm back in business again.

If you've ever seen an episode of Firefly then you might be happy to know that "<a title="'Firefly' lands in film afterlife" href="http://hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1969026">'Firefly' lands in film afterlife</a>". I for one would love to see this happen. It was a dam good show.

I started classes on wednesday. I'll fill you in later.
I also still have on class left today so I'll be back later.
