I'm cleaning up some old draft posts that I never wrote out. This one is even more relevant today then when I planned to write it.

I own a dirfwear wallet, and while it isn't perfect at blocking rfid tags at close range (3-4 inches) its a dam good walet and will stop distance and opportunistic sniffing. Like near a turnstyle or door frame. I met one of the creators at <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/post/605/the-last-hope/">the last hope</a> and played with a machine he had there setup for reading rfid cards at a distance.
