We're leaving one of our ISP's here at work. And I was asked to take care of it. We're still on contract but they broke it long long ago.
I'll have logs of downed an unacceptably high latency connections and all the excuses they've given us over the months. But I need to start the ball rolling by writing a letter. This is what I have so far..

<blockquote>To: Towerstream<br/>
Subject: Termination of Service<br/>
John,<br/>
We'd like to leave your shitty fucking service Immediately.

You lied to us.

Love,
Francis</blockquote>
