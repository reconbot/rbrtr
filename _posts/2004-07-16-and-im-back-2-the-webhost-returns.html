Things have a been a little screwy lately due to problems at my Host. All of the stuff should be working again and should not break any further (at least not for the same reasons). About time if I don't say so my self.

Kumar is a machine they tell me, in reality he's one of the most visible technicians and fixes peoples problems quite quickly. He's also been around the longest I hear. I managed to catch him when he got up around 4 am this morning (he's in india so he follows IST not EST) and fix everything for me. And then I was done. He even stuck a fork in me. (Irc is such an odd medium.)
