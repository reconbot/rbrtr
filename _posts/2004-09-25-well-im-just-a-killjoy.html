So if I don't take my meds before 9am every morning (they don't take off for weekends and holidays) which means going to bed at night, 1am latest, 11pm on work nights, I'm gonna feel like a college freshman from a uptight family who gave him no freedoms the morning after his first night out.

Jesus these headaches. Its like a hangover and a fight with large truck all wrapped into one.
