I like to think RAW images are a far superior way to take images because you get more data and can mess with the white balances etc. The problem always being I don't know how to mess with the data to get better photos. And when I tout "Oh well don't worry we'll just use Raw" when referring to light conditions etc, I often get jeered because I don't know what I'm talking about.

It's true, but I'm not wrong.

Using nothing but "auto" settings, I've doctored up a photo I took of Alex in two formats (I used Sara's camera which can take both Raw and Jpeg at the same time. A Canon Digital Rebel XTi E05 if you're wondering, but that doesn't mean much to me.)

If this looks odd below you can click through to the <a href="/dev/catcompare/">comparison tool's page itself</a>.

If you can read this then you should click though to the article to see some fancy JS comparison tools. Or just <a href="/dev/catcompare/">click through to the tool itself</a>.
