Tonight I saw A Perfect Circle in concert. They were pretty good and who ever was managing the show did them justice. The lighting, the set, the sound it was wonderful that manager did right by APC.

I have also confirmed my belief that even though it's an hour and 45 minutes away from here (as opposed to 30 minutes) the sound at PNC Bank Arts Center is <i>twice</i> times better then Camden's Tweeter Center and that it vastly makes up for extra traveling.

I was smiling after the show and a waitress noticed at a diner afterwards and told me to never stop being happy. =)

I wish I was really happy - I'm working on it though. Self pity is a path that no one wants to read about. I've just been angry lately, at my self first and foremost, I'm really not doing well at this end of semester thing, and at... other people. I'm going to feign my oncoming panic attack and change the subject.

There's some really cool stuff in the music world.
Let me get the small stuff out of the way.

Mini Kiss opened for tonight's show. They were small, weren't really playing musical instruments, and they sucked. But they were "little people" and they were dressed as Kiss, it was kinda neat.

The Burning Brides opened for APC. The were neither burning nor brides as Sarah pointed out. And they kinda sucked. But they had a chick bassist , and I've got a weak spot for chick bassist. (Women who play the Base guitar - I was using another word that was wrong - thanks to Andrew for the tip) Paz who used to play for APC but then joined Zwan (I saw her in concert) is a chick bassist. Unfortunately who ever the basest is in Burning Brides has no rhythm and it bothers me. She would play and play well but she would also attempt to move to the beat and would convulse instead. I couldn't figure out how one could move to a completely different beat and still play the first one. Anyway APC after loosing Paz picked up James Iha who is dam good. (Iha used to play with Billy Corgan in Smashing Pumpkins.)

I started thinking that with all the people from all these bands working together (APC, Zwan/Smashing Pumpkins, tool, Manson and NiN to name a few) and trading band members, they must know each other well. Sarah assumes they're all friends, while based in reality it's really what she wants to be true. I figure they're at least on each others Christmas lists.

I keep mentioning Sarah because she's the one who played me APC for my first time, she's also the one that got the tickets, and the one who knows more about these cool bands then anyone I know. Thank you Sarah!

I got to goto sleep. I apologize for the... mottled post but it is late and I am tired. Hope all is well in all your worlds because mine is about to become nothing but dreams. ;-)

PS Speaking of dreams I had an odd one the other day. I got married and I knew it wasn't going to work out. I also belittled the patron of the hall where the reception was because he was charging for plates. It was odd...

I just heard 3 explosions, possibly gun fire, probably fireworks. I need to find a new place to live, I'm glad I'm moving out of this one.
