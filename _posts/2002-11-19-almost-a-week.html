I love how big things like this can go unnoticed. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,56463,00.html">Wired News</a> has an article about how a
bug in Microsoft's Internet Explorer could cause a web page to be able to format your hard drive. Hell it could
do anything actually. Slashdot was talking about how some script kiddy made a site showing how it could install
trogon virus. The kind they wage attacks with. If a kid was smart he could have it collect email addresses or
credit card numbers. Spam enough people with an infected link and you get 10-100 times the amount of addresses
back with most of them working. <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/computing/security/info/iehot.shtml">This site</a>
has a little more info on what you can do to help save your self. But there is nothing yet that can keep you
completely safe from this threat. Well there is <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">something...</a>
<p>Some guy bulk purchased bthsnews.com and setup a portal site. Its a nice get rich scheem but he didn't need my domain! I have bthsnews.net though. Not like anyone's ever going there. .Org is obscure enough.<p>-<a href="mailto:wizard@roborooter.com">Francis</a>
