I opened up a voting for a gallery.

The <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=otakoncosplays&page=1">Cosplays of Otakon 2001</a>

You can vote for each picture (give it a rating) and see the total. This is the first gallery I'm trying voting for. I want to see how it works out. =)
