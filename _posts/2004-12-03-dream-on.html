For some reason I tend to veer away from <a href="http://www.aerosmith.com/">Aerosmith</a> these days, but today I got a request for "Dream On" and gladly played it. It's nice once in a while.

My good friend Jason (who's portfolio is growing) decided on a whim to take my wiki logo and turn it into a new look for roborooter. We both decided that the robot's colors were ugly (be glad you didn't see) but I really liked the new layout. Before I could get a proper nap on the couch, Jason had whipped up this newer, cleaner, Roborooter.

Enjoy everybody.
