Updating has been difficult lately. Mostly because I've moved! I'm now about 5 blocks further away from the hosue I grew up in. Every year I seem to go 5 more blocks down 8th ave.

Getting all of our stuff into this new house was a chore. Andrew and myself have just a tad too many things to throw in a bag and deliver to a new homestead. It would have been an impossible task if it weren't for a few friends who showed up in the nick of time to lend a hand.

My good friend Jason was the first to show up and stayed with us all day and into the night. This is the 3rd time he's done this and all he's ever asked for was lunch and dinner. (and beer - which I still owe him) My brother was around for a little while and helped move my television into our van. It was a gift that I've been paying for ever since. While beautiful (HD, good speakers, lots of inputs) it's about 300 pounds of suffering, that moves once a year. It took a few hours before we moved it out of the van. Caroline showed up a bit later and immediatly called for backup. Both Caroline and Tina moved box after box well into the night. I'm fairly certian I'm slightly responcible messing up their plans for the next two days, school and work come secondary when you're as tired as they were when they left. Late comers were Jeremy, my Mother and Mike, who helped get some of the details (and heavy lifting) that we were missing after hours of labor.

The entire night ended (for most people) with a lovely diner at my favorite restraunt Two Boots. Thanks to my Father many delicious dishes were had by all of us. We were tired, hungry, and grumpy and it made the night good again.

Thank you everybody who helped. I'm still sore, but I would have been broken if it weren't for you. Me and Andrew are getting the place setup and will have a housewarming in a few weeks. Much free food for everyone.

Even today as I write this, I still have other boxes left to move. I also figure my moving karma slightly lacking, I've helped a few people in my time, but I think after 3 moves in 3 years I need to give a little bit more back. Just remember, if you helped me, you've now got positve moving Karma, it's going to come in handy one day.
