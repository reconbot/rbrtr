To any of my friends thinking of going protesting against the republican national convention I just have one thing to say.

You better go dressed like this.

<a href="http://www.roborooter.com/ftp/movies/madisonrobots.avi">Madison Robots</a>

And for the quick minded - yes I'm trying out nyud.net's distributed mirroring project, I've quickly learned that if that link hasn't been clicked on for a while the first person who does will get the movie dam ass slow. If for some reason years from now that link doesn't work or you want to see the movie fast, just remove the .nyud.net:8090 part of the link.

Also remember that screaming car commercial? My bandwidth got hosed the first few days that was around. I never had so many hits over some stupid video. I hope some of you stayed around for my quick wit and catchy banter ;-)

(Before my friends start, shut the fuck up.)
