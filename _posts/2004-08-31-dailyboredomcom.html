You all remember that <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/000514.html">car commercial</a> I posted about a week or two ago? Well apparently the link to the movie has circulated around the web a bit. I've had more traffic to my site then ever before. To the point where today I hit 80% of my bandwidth limit. In fact this month's usage has been 7 times any other month.

Well I found out why.

<a href="http://www.dailyboredom.com/">Dailyboredom.com</a> which boasts "Boredom Reduction Is Just A Click Away! Visit These Incredibly Un-Boring Sites" linked directly to the movie. Apparently its a semi popular site. It generated 1240 hits on the movie.

Well they're going to have to read my post about it before viewing the image now.

Anyway I'm pleased I've been been main stream before.
