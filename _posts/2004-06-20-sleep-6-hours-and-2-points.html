I've been having trouble sleeping lately.  I'll goto bed and wake up a few hours later and I won't be able to get back to sleep. Last night I got to sleep around 11 and around 1 my phone rang, and then again around 2. I keep it on for emergencies and my friends who always forget to sleep at night. If I don't want to get a call I won't keep it on, simple as that. But usually, in fact always, I'll go right back to sleep when woken, except this time I couldn't sleep at all, so I was awake from 2am until ... well now, (2am ish) with a few naps in between. I read somewhere you can function sleeping half an hour every 4 hours but only for a few days (then your body needs more rest). While I don't recommend it, it seemed to work today.

So I took my 6 hour drivers point reduction class. It was... entertaining. An ex cop talked with us and showed us videos that loosely followed this book he gave us. He didn't say stuff like "drive the speed limit" and "Stop at stop signs" instead everything stressed driving safe and keeping good distance from things. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. My favorite lie though was about drunk driving. "As a host its your responsibility to make sure your guests don't drive drunk as well as your guests. Try ending the party with food or start making weaker drinks at the end of the night. Why would you want to get anyone drunk anyway?"

The class had a bunch of younger people 18-25 and a bunch of older people 35-55 and not a single one of us kept from laughing.

It was all moot though, I'll get the 2 points off my NJ license and then I'll get a NY one and my points won't transfer. And despite that car insurance is still an arm and a leg in brooklyn (the most expensive in the state) and I'll have to trade my volvo for a vespa or something. I haven't figured out what I'm going to do there quite yet.

I need to sleep better.
