A lot of things have happened lately. Let me list them. <p>1) I got a new phone. Its the same number. And its new to me not exactly a "brand new" phone. I have to thank Cindy for this one. It used to be hers.<br>2) Frank's car (which he lent to me for a month) has died. I'll get into it later but it went in for repair and its not coming out. I left some stuff in it too...<br>3) I'm taking a leave of absence from Rowan University this semester - I'll be back next semester. In my own apartment no less (you wouldn't believe how much money I'll save. And I won't need a meal plan - You don't know how much you get screwed with those.)
<br>4) The day after Easter I'm going to spend 12 days in Washington State visiting my family.<p>I'm sure there's more but I have to go rent a van so I can move out of my dorm room on friday. <p>-Francis
