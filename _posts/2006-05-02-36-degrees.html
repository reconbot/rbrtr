So the other day my computer started an alarm. "BOOEEEP!! BOOEEEP!!" It started it's own tempature alarm while doing hardly anything. I took a look down and really.. not enough fans. My bios claimed a cpu temp of 67 degrees, the alam triggered at 60, so I upped the alarm and got some fans. And after spending all night installing the fans, (I can't put in the motherboard with the new heatsync attached - it's freaking huge) my cpu temp is now a fine 36 degrees. =)

(And with all the fans turned down, (Yea I got a fan controler too) a cool 40 degrees.)
