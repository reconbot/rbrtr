Take 12 people, and ask them a personal question. Let them answer from the heart. Let them really get into it. Now spend the next 10-14 hours in a room (eat all your meals together, and don't talk when someone leaves the room) and argue that they are wrong.

If you can't convince them, start again tomorrow at 9:30, and to sweeten the deal have some people that are probably dangerous hang out in front of the building you're in and take the train with you home.

It's been three weeks, this is really getting to me.
