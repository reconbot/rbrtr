Go watch Martin Scorsese's "Hugo" based off the book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" by Brian Selznick. Don't however watch any trailers or pay attention to any advertising. Whoever was in charge of marketing this movie screwed it up royally. I hadn't seen the trailers, and now that I've seen them I can say, "Don't watch them!". They are misleading and give away important plot points.

Other non-spoiling things I learned about Hugo from it's marketing that turned out to be untrue.
<ul>
<li>It was animated.</li>
<li>It was a love story.</li>
<li>It was about a heart shaped key.</li>
<li>It was about a little boy who's a thief on the run from the law for killing possibly his father.</li>
<li>It was about a steampunk 1930's Paris.</li>
<li>It was about a robot who befriends Hugo after Hugo fixes him.</li>
<li>It was about a crooked Paris Inspector who hates little kids.</li>
<li>Everyone is Paris is English.</li>
</ul>

I don't want to tell you what the movie was about because discovering it was half the fun. Maybe that's what the movie was about, Adventure and discovery.

Enjoy.
