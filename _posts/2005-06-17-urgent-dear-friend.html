Dear friend,

This letter may come to you as a suprise due to the fact that we have not yet met.The message could be strange but real if you pay  some attention,I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity;Please accept my sincere apologies in bringin this message of good will to you,Ihave to say that i have no intentions of causing you any embarassment.

I am Mr TIMI SOUWARIN,Branch manager,Broad Bank Nigeria [ltd]Oweer.I managed to get your contact details through the internet my self.Time is of the importance and Iam despperately looking for a person to assit me in this confidential business.A british oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian investment corporation,Mr frank van dijck made a numberd time[fixed] deposit on january 6,1999,valued at US$12,500,000.00[twelve million five hundred thousand dollars] for twelve[12] calendar months in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a rutine notification to his fowarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian Investment Corporation that Mr Frank Van dijck died from an automobile accident on sunday evening July16, 2000.On futher investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr Frank van dijck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my bank;this sum of US$12,500,000.00 is  still sitting in my bank and the interst is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one would ever come forward to claim it . According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of 6 [six] years the will revert to to the ownership of the Nigerian Goverment if nobody applies to claim the fund as the deceased kinship.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as Mr frank van Dijck so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt goverment officials.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that my attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ to lawyers for drafting and notorization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administation in your favour for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world that you  will provide will the fecilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid in to your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
.There is no risk at all as all  the paperwork for this tansaction will be done by the attorney and my possition as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Upon your response,I shall then provide you more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require  your assitance to invest my share in your country,pls send your fax and phone numbers for voice communication with you.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.

Thanks,
Timi souwarin.
