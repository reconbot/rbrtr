I've gotten too many phone calls and emails about my *dire* situation. I figured that would make some kind of reactions but people thought I was buying drugs or hanging on the street. People! Just because I'm living in Jersey ::shakes head::<p>
I took notes on the ordeal so I wouldn't forget.<p>
It all stated with me and my friend Sarah talking about doing homework. We got food instead. Well we wanted to but it was 1 am and the food court had just closed.  Taco Bell on the other hand is open until 2 am. So we went there. <p>"Excuse me can you please move I can't server you with out a car."<p> I tried to <strike>argue</strike> persuade the lady on the other side of the drive through menu to let us buy food. We <b>had</b> money. What's the problem? We gave up and walked to the Burger King. I made sure to let the people waiting in the drive through line know too.<p>
Burger king, Mc Donalds, Wendy's, and Dunkin Donuts were all closed. Papa Johns was another story. Pickups close at 1 am it was 1:20 am. Deliveries were still going on though. We asked the people if we could get a pie delivered to the sidewalk in front. The lady was like <p>"I don't think were going to do that."<p>We walked over to the Block Buster and the guy moping up wanted nothing to do with us. We would have given him a slice of pizza! The Amaco station attendant down the road was more then helpful. He even let me use his phone. Unfortunately that same lady who was rude in front of the Papa Johns was even worse on the phone. She took the order and then;<p> "Our computer shows that to be an Amaco station"<br>"It is an Amaco Station"<p>"I need a phone number."<p> I started to give her the phone number of the cell phone but she insisted that it needed to be a land line. The Amaco man dug the station number out of the phone and I gave it to her. She told me to hold on a second and went out side the Papa John's. We all waved. It took a few minutes but when someone came back on the phone it was the manager.<p>"I'm sorry but to insure the safety of our drivers we can only deliver to a house." <i>fucker quit bothering us</i><p> I could have argued that a 24 hour Amaco station with security cameras was a hell of a lot safer then a random house or the Papa Johns its self, but it had come to a point where it really didn.t matter what they said or how we responded. The answer was no. I was fucking hungry and I hung up. I thanked the Amaco man, he was real nice, didn't even want a slice. We were probably the most interesting thing to happen all week. If I had his job I would develop a serious game boy addiction.<p>We walked past the Papa Johns really close to the window holding out our money. I wanted to yell .fuck you. really loud, I was hungry damm it. Sarah said if we made it back to the dorm really quickly we could call them and order a pizza legitimately (hey! It was plenty legitimate before!). I was still pissed at them but I was hungry too. We started walking back and we ran into a couple walking toward the mall area that we just left.<p>
"Do you know where we can get food?"<p>We told them about our little adventure. While we were talking a car drove past slowed down and tossed an egg and a zip lock baggie of Tabasco sauce at us and yelled,<p> "Fuck you! You fucking faggots!"<p> We all kind of stared at the egg (the baggie barley made it to the curb), it had landed between us missing everyone. I flipped them off. The couple decided to see if Shop Right if was still open and we wished them a good night. Me and Sarah kept walking towards campus. <p>"Ohh thank heaven its 7-11"<p> 7-11s have food. We walked in and a group of kids started cracking up laughing. We ignored them and started looking at drinks. On their way out this girl turned around,<p>"We threw an egg at you right? And Tabasco sauce and an onion and hehaha ha ha!"<br>"You missed."<p>The group was drunk and high. They piled into a familiar car and sped off. We dropped off the sodas at the counter and started telling the clerk our story. He said they come in all the time. He also said the girl just back from 2 weeks juvie, and the guys were fined $1000 and $650 all for selling drugs. Apparently he works part time at the Glassburro Court house. The Girls father died when she was 13, he was a legionnaire or something in France. The Girl is only 17 her self and the police can.t wait until she turns 18. She.s not going to come back then. Apparently most Glassboro kids are junkies and the like.<p>The attendant also lived in Brooklyn for 3 years. He says Brooklyn is better, safer then down town Glassboro too (by the Franklin house). Apparently if I go there I better bring my gun. <p> He was a real nice guy (says Sarah . I.d listen to her if I were you.) even gave us a discount on our <a href="http://www.7-eleven.com/products/product_detail.asp?catalog%5Fname=7ElevenNew&category%5Fname=Foods+To+Go&subcategory%5Fname=Hot+Off+The+Grill&product%5Fid=00032&thumb=1">Snack Stix</a> They tasted pretty good too. While we were in there some kids bought a carton of eggs. Its not safe to walk dammit. I hate fucking frats.<p>On the way home we got to see 2 of the 4 .Ropo. that our campus has on call at any given moment. Not like they have thousands of square feet to patrol, they can just hang out together if they want to. Fine By ME. I'll rant about the security around here later. I want to change a few things.<p>That's it my notes end there. I skipped something about my friends being drunk when I got home but it was a Saturday night so that's a given. But once everyone calmed down we all talked and had a good time. <p>On a completely unrelated note I'd like to add that everyone's so obsessed with fucking football dammit! My high school didn't even have a field up until recently and still nobody cares. Sweet Jesus.
