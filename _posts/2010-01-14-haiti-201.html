<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">This week Haiti was destroyed</a>.

Most of the country. Haiti <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Haiti">not without it's problems</a> before have now overnight lost about 100,000 people. To put it in scale that's over 50 times the number of people who died in hurricane Katrina, and that's only in the first few days.

The U.S., China, and the EU are all stepping up to help and give aid. The country will need to be rebuilt. This will be the first time I'm going to get to watch a country be rebuilt that isn't at war. (Other countries may have been destroyed and rebuilt in my lifetime but I haven't watched them.)

The concept of Country building blows my mind. I have a feeling that there is already large power plays going on around which country gets to rebuild (and possibly own or control) Haiti. Interesting times ahead.
