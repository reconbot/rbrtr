I'm not sure what to say about this movie. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0162346">Here</a> let me link you first.

These two girls. They graduate high school (well sorta). One of them gets a job, an apartment, starts to do things with her life. The other just gets confused. But it's not like she's doing nothing with her life. Its just she doesn't like where she is or what she's doing. She's just sorta floating while life pulls her in all sorts of directions. And in the end she doesn't conquer her problems or find direction in life, she runs. Its too late to figure this all out.

Credit goes to my little brother for recommending this film to me. Many times. Seriously he loves this movie. Its #1 on his list. He showed me.
