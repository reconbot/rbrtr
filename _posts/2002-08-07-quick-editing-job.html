I just did a quick editing job* on the most recent news posts, fixing the format of dates, the spelling, and in select cases, the grammar. If you find any more errors or inconsistencies&#8212;or if you have gripes about how I've butchered your writing&#8212;<a href="mailto:mecha@roborooter.com" title="email mecha">email me</a>.
<p>Oh, right [takes out shiny, swirling thing]. <em>You will shop at Francis's virtual yard sale...</em>**
<br>-<a href="mailto:mecha@roborooter.com" title="email mecha">mecha</a>, still a student
<tt><p>*   Bless Vi for its regular expression support!
<br>**  Many <strike>No</strike> actual users were mind-controlled by the posting of this news.***
<br>*** Maybe we were better off using a system that didn't allow users to edit each other's posts. =) And what ever happened to my little news PHP script anyway?</tt>
