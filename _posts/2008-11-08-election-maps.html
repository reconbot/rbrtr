<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/">Election maps</a>.

This site demonstrates a point that I was talking about the other day. There is a lot fewer people in the "Bread Basket" then there are along the coasts (Including the Gulf of Mexico). I was relating the age of the civilization in the area of the country to it's tolerance for cultures and it's diversity. Notice I said relating, not correlating. I don't have any data for this theory yet, just some poor observations. 

Election results by county.

Election results by country as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram">area cartogram</a> based off of population of counties.

Cartograms are wonderfully powerful at conveying data (maybe not as wonderful at representing data). You should take a look at <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cartograms/">a few samples of them</a> before you move on.
