Recently I discovered <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org">Room to Read</a>. It's a global non profit started by an ex-marketing director of Microsoft that creates schools and libraries in third world countries. It's run like a profitable business and expanding like one too. They're opening more libraries a day then Starbucks or McDonalds can open stores.

As of their last quarter their stats are;
<ol>
	<li>Schools 1,450</li>
	<li>Libraries 12,522</li>
	<li>Books Published 591</li>
	<li>Books Distributed 10 million</li>
	<li>Girls' Education Participants 13,667</li>
	<li>Children Benefited 6.0 million</li>
</ol>

This doesn't include the over <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/page.aspx?pid=282">500 children's books they've commissioned and published</a> in local lanaguages to aid in their quest for world wide literacy.
