<a href="http://www.kaena.lycos.fr/index.php?id=1&lang=en">Kaena The Prophecy</a>!!

I've had a <a href="http://www.kaena.lycos.fr/index.php?id=32&lang=en&mainmedia=1">picture</a> from the downloads in my picture folder from a long time ago, back when the movie was a small independent "off the shelf" production. Apparently they were all... umm not out, on production software so they could afford to do the project, I guess. Honestly it was a long time ago, nice to see it's finally released.

It's French "Kaena: La proph√àtie".
