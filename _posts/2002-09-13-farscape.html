Today I found out that the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/">Sci-Fi</a> channel was canceling Farscape. Not because it sucked or nobody watches it but because it was becoming too expensive to make. Slashdot is running an <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/12/1737226&mode=nested&tid=167">artical</a> about it. So I called Sci-Fi's Viewer comment line at 212-413-5000 and left a message. I also went to this web page <a href="http://www.interpage.net/sub-wwwfax.html">http://www.interpage.net/</a> and sent a fax (free) to these numbers  212-413-6531 212-413-6522 212-413-6503 212-413-6524. Requesting them not to cancel it. I think I've done my part. Do yours. =)<p><a href="http://www.farscapeworld.com/main.shtml">www.farscapeworld.com</a><br><a href="http://farscape.wdsection.com/">Save Farscape</a>
