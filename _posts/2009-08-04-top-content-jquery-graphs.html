I found a really cool jQuery graphing plugin over at <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com">The Filament Group</a>. They constantly pump out great little toolkits they make for their clients. I'm just a consumer at the moment, but I'm loving the idea that I can cultivate what I learn into something I can share back. All in time. Another iFrame today. If you can't see the table and graph below (or if you want to check the source) check out the <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/dev/Roborooter%20Traffic%20Graph/index.html">original document</a>.
