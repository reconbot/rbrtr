I grew up on this show (along with the A-Team and many others) and just today after 20 years I realized something. Most of those jumps and explosions that Kit drives through were filmed with a remote control car! The wheels give it away, they do an amazing job preserving the scale of everything else.

I just can't believe its been a model all this time. I thought they had a tricked out car or something.

But to be fair not all the stunts are by an RC car, just... a bunch of them.

Bah! =0
