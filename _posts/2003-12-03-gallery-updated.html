I updated the gallery today. I was going to write an update to the blog but that would require thinking about my day and recent events. I will add a few things.

Movies I've recently seen.
Secretary
Ginger Snaps
Being John Malkovich
Scarface

I'll talk about them (and laugh about them, and warn you about them) all later.

I also gave blood today. My first time. My friend Matt has given over a gallon total. Considering a human adult has around 8 pints of blood he has given over a full human of blood. Scary. Sitting in the chairs waiting to be harvested I couldn't stop thinking of the matrix and how the machines harvested humans. It wasn't that bad giving blood though.

And right of course the <a href="http://gallery.roborooter.com/">gallery</a>.

My favorite new feature other then the ugly theme I currently have is the <b><a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~gulotta/gallery/slideshow.php">random slide show</a></b>. It shows you 25 pictures at random from the entire gallery. Its a nice peek at what I have to show.

Also <b>ignore the voting</b>. I might keep voting in the sense where you can give each picture a rank, but right now its a mix between that and voting in the sense where you have two choose 5 pictures in the order you like them. Its also a clutter and my gallery isn't called amIhotORnot. So don't pay it much mind.

<b>PS</b>
I just reset the galleries (restored from backup) and turned off voting. I can turn it on for specific albums.

On a more personal note I also just found my red shirt. I had lost it a week ago and it somehow mixed it self back in with my laundry and I just found it in the dryer. I am very pleased.
