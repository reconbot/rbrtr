I figured it would take some cool graphics and links to help draw readers back to the site after its downfall. (Repeated downfalls.)
<p>Let me first present to you, My trip to california in 90.3 seconds!<br>You can download it here. (Still making it come back later)<p>
I've also found a few cool links in my travels over the past few days. <a href="http://www.foulds2000.freeserve.co.uk/">Andy Foulds Design</a> falls under the catagory "What the hell do I do with it?" Its a really cool website wich has a bunch of proof of concept flash designs. Everything from test user interfaces to a peep show. (The peep show being the only bit of content that I wouldn't exactly show your young kids - but they wouldn't be able to figure out the interface anyway.) I found this guys site by folowing a link my friend Sarah gave me that brought me to an <a href="http://www.urban75.com/Mag/bubble.html">Perpetual BubbleWrap</a> popping game.
<p>I also started to bring the other sections of the site back online. The pictures are now there but the galery script is still broken. The staff page (wich I should just bring over into the pictures anyway) goes into an endless loop (I disabled it) and the contact now points to a working email address.
