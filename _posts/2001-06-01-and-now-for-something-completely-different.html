<img src="/images/blake.jpg" align="left" />I figured that it was time to link this whiteboard thing that Francis got somewhere. Needs Java. Also, while poking around in /www, I found that it appears we will have a web design site here at some point. So far it looks very clean and well made, so as soon as I talk to the creator, I'll link it up here. Focal says my DSL should be working soon, so when it finally is I can work on this from home. Friday... (And since this is the 11th news item, it gets rid of that dumb testing one.)<br>-<a href="mailto:rooney@roborooter.com">Rooney</a>
