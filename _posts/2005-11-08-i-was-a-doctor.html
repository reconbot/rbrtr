I was.

Most of america dressed up last monday (the one before the one yesterday) for an event known to many as Halloween. I on the other hand was not aware of this event, but as it turns out it saved me from charges of impersonating a doctor.

Now that I think about it, my plan to get free tongue depressors was pretty thin as it was.

I missed the parade (work) but <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2005/11/rb_05_nov_01_1.html">Rocketboom attended</a> and it was great.
