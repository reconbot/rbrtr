<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/news/8/8/9">Transparent Aluminum</a> anyone?

In <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home </a> gives some poor misguided engineer the molecular formula for transparent aluminum in trade for some Plexiglas, so they could make a tank to steal a bunch of wales.

And now they figured out a way to make glass out of aluminum oxide. And apparently if you really wanted you could do the same with many other oxides.. or metals... read the article and find out which.

I just thought this was really cool.

<b>UPDATE:</b> Aluminum is not Aluminum Oxide. It's... not exactly a metal. But its stronger then regular glass. Its still cool.

And did anyone hear that someone just stole <a href="http://www.roborooter.com/archives/images/munch-scream.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.roborooter.com/archives/images/munch-scream.html','popup','width=625,height=850,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">The Scream</a>? Some guys just walked into Sweden (well a museum there anyway) and took it.
